				In some circuits, Black women have become
				valuable commodities on the social scale. As fem¬
				inism has become respectable and Black women
				criticize white women on their racism, a lot of
				whites want to prove it's just not so. They invite
				us to submit articles, perform, read, or speak on
				panels. This has brought about a relatively new
				situation in my life—whites coming to me, asking
				for input.
				Once I welcomed being in this position; often I
				went for it. I consciously figured on getting across
				as a token. That position would be my point of
				entry to places where white racism would ordi¬
				narily have left me out of the program. Now with
				a Black women's community to live and work in,
				white structures are not so appealing. I look back
				with bitterness at whites whose dealings with me
				were not based on who I am, but on what I look
				like: a Black woman to fit into their program.
				It was a real disservice when white women
				looked at me, saw the Black, and greeted me with
				eagerness because of a hidden agenda. It took a
				while before I realized it wasn't my charm and
				personal magnetism that was operating—I've got
				a big ego and I'm a slow learner. How bitterly I
				remember the white women who took me in as a
				token and how bitterly I remember myself going
				for the bait—hook, line, and sinker. I want to be
				treated as an individual, not seen with awe and
				fear as someone's dream nightmare. I want to be
				seen as a person who wants to do a job for
				reasons not unlike their own: a person subject to
				pride, fear, greed, anger, ambition, high ideals,
				willingness, trust, and love, like themselves. In¬
				stead, many see me as a Third World" woman
				to be used to make a project look good if I act
				right.
				I feel a personal shame for having been will¬
				ing to be that statistic or chocolate chip in the ses
				of white cookie. From that token's position, I
				tried to take myself somewhere, but doubted
				underneath that I could have gotten in on my owr
				merit, not being sure of my place in the structure.
				That's the legacy I inherited from the perverted
				relationship where some whites looked good
				practicing tokenism and I was willing to let them
				get over through me. I was left not knowing
				where I really stood with them, trying to figure
				out what they thought I was, and then trying to
				be that so I could do what I wanted to do in
				service of who I really was.
				Once I looked with trust to the feminist option.
				It was the minority viewpoint I would read and
			</p>
         <p>
				hunger after and identify with. I appreciate that
				there is a women's community with networks and
				publications, and that we do share a general
				point of view. With feminism established as a
				part of the current order, some things are easier
				for me, but elements of the old ways do continue
				to take on new forms. Now that a feminist angle
				is being targeted into cigarette commercials,
				feel ripped off all over again. In a like manner,
				Black is "hip"—well, not so hip anymore. More
				accurately, now white women are supremely
				sensitive to being accused of racism and try to
				avoid the word like the plague; it makes their shit
				turn to water if anyone even thinks the word in
				their direction. Now that they are conscious of
				Black women who come out with such very hip
				analysis and delivery, many of them want to hold
				onto us.
				I resent feeling that they want us around for
				the power of our image: picture a handsome,
				angry Black woman on the cover of many a mag¬
				azine that ever so rarely deals with a Black view¬
				point. So many women who are talking about
				racism are more concerned about public rela¬
				tions than they are with gut-level sisterhood.
				They want us so that they don't have to feel un¬
				comfortable should any Blacks call them on the
				question, or should any other whites get into the
				game of reminding their sisters that there are no
				women of color in evidence. Real reconstruction is
				bypassed. It's easier to opt for the cosmetic treat¬
				ment. This is like being a nice girl. You smile
				at anyone who smiles at you and you don't dislike
				anyone because that's the way you've been
				brought up. But the truth of it all is that only by
				trading honest viewpoints can people negotiate
				and work out frank differences.
				White women deny that they seek out women
				of color because pressure has been put on them
				These white women are almost trained to re¬
				spond with a politically correct manner when
				they're questioned. If some of them would ac¬
				knowledge resentment or that they are bewil¬
				dered that they can't seem to do anything right
				by Black women anymore, some truth could
				emerge that'd free us on all sides. But so many
				are afraid to come from anything other than
				masks of good behavior.
				Yet I know now when whites are running
				from me, trying to deflect any confrontations they
				fear I will want to bring into play. I can tell by
				their aggression on the subjects of race and rac¬
				ism—as though it were outside of them somehow
				or as if by giving an appropriate nod to guilt
				blame, and responsibility in a politically correc¬
				stance, they'll be safe from the anger they seem
				to expect from me. They are ill at ease and run
				from a feeling of discomfort that they project onto
				me. When whites beat their breasts and tall
			</p>
         <p>
				about what's being done to the poor darkies, they
				are still taking the missionary position and fuck¬
				ing Black people.
				I have yet to hear white women talk about
				Black women as people, as individuals they like
				or dislike. In the conversations I have heard, we
				are either heroic," surviving," or 'triply op-
				pressed." They'll urge sympathy on us for Black
				men's purported sexism or condemn white men
				as a class group, but never voice a criticism of
				Black women. It makes me wonder. When a
				white woman assumes l'd be interested in some¬
				thing just because l'm a Black person, Iwithdraw
				one giant step inside. I'm dismayed when I see
				women at concerts or poetry readings knowing
				how to clap in all the right places and saying a
				nervous "yeah"—as if by verbal affirmation of
				Black women's performance their guilt can be
				discharged and penance done so blame is de¬
				flected from them.
				Today, white women see a lot of Black women
				who want to give their energy solely to Black
				women rather than deal with whites. I imagine
				white women often don’t know what to do and
				feel perplexed. A good number of Black women
				don’t want to be bothered teaching or working
				with them because whites aren't as innocent in
				their racism as they put out. Others get mad at
				whites for trying to include Black people. It seems
				like you're damned if you do and damned if you
				don't—so what's a poor little white girl to do?
				This thinking is, of course, not leading to the
				real truth. I think the answer to the seeming
				paradox is for the white women to do their own
				consciousness-raising and examine what they
				come up with among themselves. The working
				out of racist attitudes is process work for white
				women to do for themselves, with one another.
				Once they can see themselves through the rough
				stuff, they will actually be freer and truer to
				themselves. I appreciate that kind of honesty in
				an individual more than a correct line. Honesty is
				something Isense, can open up to and trust. Race
				differences are real, but they're not everything.
				We work out our real differences from honesty.
				But after they've done their own CR, I hope
				these whites don't come to me for a stamp of ap¬
				proval. I'm having a hard enough time dealing
				with my own stuff and hoping my women will give
				me the pats on the back I crave. I don't think
				many Black women are going to credit whites for
				doing their own homework. Whites seem to want
				this at some level and when it doesn't come, they
				feel pissed and neglected. Well, that's not enough
				for Black women who have other concerns and
				don't want to play nanny in any mode. I've been
				brought up to feel I should be grateful for every
				little bit of progress, but I frankly do get angry at
				white women who are actively trying to deal with
				their racism and the new trips they lay on me in
				their growth process. Those white women who
				aren't so anxious and eager to clean up their acts
				and attitudes around race are the ones I can
				have friendships with. It's a tricky balance to
				find, but I think the important personal quality I
				respond to is honesty.
				What is going on with all our concerns about
				racism is, indeed, change. There is a willingness
				among some white women to do some work, but
				the transformation isn’t complete yet. Racist atti¬
				tudes linger because the job isn’t all the way
				done. People who haven’t seen that change is
				possible can’t wholeheartedly believe in it. If
				they haven’t lived it in their personal lives, it's
				hard to see change in political terms. It won't all
				come together in one fell swoop. After the major
				reconstruction, there will be corners to straight¬
				en out and the maintenance work will be a day¬
				to-day job. But this is Life Work. Any attempt to
				make it better can only come to good.
