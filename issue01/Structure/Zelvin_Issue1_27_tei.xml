         <p>Zucchini Poem
				the zucchini crouches
				behind a broad green leaf
				patient in her camouflage
				imperialist tentacles of vine
				are taking over the garden
				shouting mine mine
				like a woman waiting
				for the revolution
				the zucchini bides her time
				rain falls in the night
				first stealthy
				then triumphant like a coup d'Ã©tat
				come morning
				the zucchini squats
				swollen in the sunlight
				proud of her belly
				covering the earth
				with ayellow flower behind her ear
