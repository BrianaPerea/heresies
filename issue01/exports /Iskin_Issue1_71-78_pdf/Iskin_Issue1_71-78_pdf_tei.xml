				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>The art in the exhibition included a wide range
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>of feminist work: parodies on public images of

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>the climax of Wharton&apos;s novel, when Lily Bart,

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>Hauntingly life-like, her full-size figure, bearing
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>the artist&apos;s own features, reclines in bed. Her
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>skin tone is grayish and the sleeping drops that
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>caused her death are by the side of her bed. The
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>floor is cluttered with remnants of her life:
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>letters, photographs, delicate laces, dresses,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>corsets, and veils. Youdelman creates metaphors
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>(sleep, passivity, death) for what have been
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>essential aspects of female experience: eco¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>tragedy, Lily Bart&apos;s story is emblematic for
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>women who have remained powerless in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>society.

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>choice in it.... The heavenly vision in which
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>they appear is both ideal and it is limbo.&quot; This
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>reflects Scheer&apos;s own experience as a first-time
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>mother:
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>I found the child very sensual. It was unex¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>pected to me what a strong female biological
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>experience it was to have a child, and then to be
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>absolutely in love with the child. In the course
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>of using her as model, however, I made her
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>cry, sometimes neglected her, and in a way I
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/><hi rend='italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>used</hi> her, both as a model and as inspiration.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>... I was aware that the art that makes it in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>L.A., or made it at the time (two years ago) was
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>non-image-oriented and I am very image¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>oriented. I was also entirely aware that show¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>ing babies in one&apos;s art was really outrageous,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>and it gave me a devilish pleasure, because I
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>think that a lot of art that makes it is empty
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>formula and doesn’t have any blood in it; it is
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>not daring and it is not a turn-on either. So it
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>was like breaking a taboo, and especially for a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>woman artist.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>Like Scheer Gilah Hirsch deals with female
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>power within its traditional domain. She uses
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>the imagery of food as &quot;a secret biography, a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>metaphorical code.&quot;
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>The shape and color of food itself was so com¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>pletely right and ripe for my own feelings that
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>it became a symbol for me; especially the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>tomato, strawberry, and egg became symbols
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>for myself. These are expressed in scale and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>potency; it is a strange word to use in relation¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>ship to an egg, a potent egg.... The strawberry
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>is one of the few fruits that carries its seed on
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>the outside, it is a vulnerable fruit; it is juicy
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>and has strength and vulnerability at the same
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>time.... Rather than feminist, these paintings
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>are, I think, more expressive of femaleness. It
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>was a personal statement for me.... l can&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>separate my experience from a female experi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>ence; I feel powers in me, very specifically in

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l1' n='N001'/>The traditional representation of rape in art
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l2' n='N002'/>(with the exception of Kollwitz<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>8</hi>) represents the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l3' n='N003'/>experience of the rapist by focusing on his
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l4' n='N004'/>strength, activity and beauty, and further re¬

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l6' n='N006'/>mythological disguise. Lacy first forces the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l7' n='N007'/>viewer to enact a metaphorical rape (&quot;deflower¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l8' n='N008'/>ing&quot; the book by tearing the sticker) and then
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l9' n='N009'/>confronts the viewer with what rape means to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l10' n='N010'/>its victim.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l11' n='N011'/>In Karen Carson&apos;s drawings of beds (1971-75)
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l12' n='N012'/>woman <hi rend='italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>is</hi> the bed. The drawings are expression¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l13' n='N013'/>istic in style and imagery, powerful as well as
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l14' n='N014'/>satirical statements about the myth of happi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l15' n='N015'/>ness in sexual relationships. In this case, too,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l16' n='N016'/>the &quot;disturbing“ feminist content of Carson&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l17' n='N017'/>drawings arises from the art-historical tradition
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l18' n='N018'/>of reclining female figures on beds and sofas.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l19' n='N019'/>Many of these women become an integral part
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l20' n='N020'/>of the inanimate, passive, yet sexually inviting
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l21' n='N021'/>surface on which they are reclining. Unlike
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l22' n='N022'/>males, Carson identifies with the oppressed¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l23' n='N023'/>the woman/bed—and at the same time, as art¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l24' n='N024'/>ist, she takes active charge of that surface, pen¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l25' n='N025'/>etrates it with a giant screw (<hi rend='italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>Screw</hi>), converts it

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l29' n='N029'/>These surreal visualizations are take-offs on

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l1' n='N001'/>often the starting points for the drawings. The
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l2' n='N002'/>series began as a macabre though humorous
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l3' n='N003'/>comment on popular sexist consumerism. What
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l4' n='N004'/>emerges is a violent denunciation of sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l5' n='N005'/>roles, until finally the bed—former haven of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l6' n='N006'/>consumer pleasure—disintegrates from within
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l7' n='N007'/>(<hi rend='italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>Cracking Up</hi> and <hi rend='italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>Shattered Dreams</hi>), smashing

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l10' n='N010'/>merly inanimate object erupts uncontrollably,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l11' n='N011'/>and its fragments fly into space. What is com¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l12' n='N012'/>monly labeled Women&apos;s Liberation is in fact, as
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l13' n='N013'/>Carson expresses it, an excruciatingly painful
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l14' n='N014'/>process beginning with the recognition of exte¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l15' n='N015'/>rior oppression, leading to the experience of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l16' n='N016'/>oppression from within, and finally building
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l17' n='N017'/>toward a complex re-integration—represented
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l18' n='N018'/>by the artist&apos;s new work—collages in which the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l19' n='N019'/>torn and mutilated fragments are reunited on a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l20' n='N020'/>cohesive surface.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l21' n='N021'/>I would say that these drawings were intention¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l22' n='N022'/>ally propagandistic. It had to do with con¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l23' n='N023'/>sumer and sexual politics. The frame of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l24' n='N024'/>mind that I was in when I did these drawings
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l25' n='N025'/>was severe frustration over treatment by men.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l26' n='N026'/>... The drawings were also politically charged
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l27' n='N027'/>for me because I talked about them to all kinds
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1l28' n='N028'/>of groups from Valley housewives to a con¬

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>ings and they weren’t. They seemed to have a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>good time, and related to the drawings im¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>mediately. Now, it is not necessary to have a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>good time when viewing art, but there was
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>blanket recognition of the issues.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>When I looked in the newspaper I noticed
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>that you could apply sexual politics, directly or
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>indirectly, to almost every image in the adver¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>tisement world; every image implies sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>promises. My original fantasy was that I would
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>have enough money to take out a full page ad
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>in the <hi rend='italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>L.A. Times,</hi> and just change the images
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>a little bit. Obviously the most political thing
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>about that was my fantasy about how many
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>people I could reach that way. It is the nature
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>of good political art to be recognizable and
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>understandable by a lot of people and maybe
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>at a visceral level too.... Political art is often
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>satirical, and probably most effective at that
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>level.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>The exhibition provided an opportunity to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>witness the heightened impact of contemporary
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>feminist art when viewed by a &quot;non-art“ audi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>ence—a cross-section of middle America that
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>normally would not encounter art, and specifi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>cally by a female audience alienated from femi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>nism. (The negative response came primarily
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>from women <hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>9</hi>) It can also be seen as a test case
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>for implementing a long-desired goal —bringing
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>art into a public daily work environment.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>Had the show at Aerospace been exhibited in

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>acclaim. The work was predominantly consid¬

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>jections and firm negative judgments. The show
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>was labeled <hi rend='italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>pornography</hi> rather than <hi rend='italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>art</hi> by
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>people who were unlikely ever to have consid¬

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l47' n='N047'/>This disclaimer was the protesters&apos; attempt to

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l51' n='N051'/>need not be taken seriously. The level of naive¬

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>In another letter, signed by 36 people—
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>almost a petition —the art was called:
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>... in poor taste, bad character, and a definite
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>infringement on the rights of all women and
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>men who give sex the dignity, respect and
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>honor that was intended for the human race.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>The Aerospace Corporation has drastically
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>changed its practices since the 1960s to allow
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>this type of &quot;smut“ to be exhibited, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>employees were encouraged through desk-to¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>desk distribution and advertising to view the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>exhibition.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>We are sure that with much less expense to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>the Company, the representatives... could
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>have arranged for a display of pornography,

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>female employees, as there are those of us who
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>still adhere to the old principle that we were
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>liberated immediately when we were born in
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>America, we enjoy being treated as a woman,

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>Clearly these female viewers at Aerospace
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>&quot;saw&quot; in the art their own worst fears of femi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>nism. Their objections though focused on the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>exhibition, were rooted in their alienation from
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>the organized women’s movement. Confronted
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>by art that dealt with an oppression familiar in
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>most of their lives, real images that did not
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>correspond to the illusion of the American
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>dream presented a powerful threat.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>The art was perceived as offensive precisely
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>because it was not placed in a neutralizing en¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>vironment like a gallery, where viewers can
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>easily hide behind anonymity. The art invaded
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>their own daily working sphere where it threat¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>ened how they were viewed in their professional
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>positions. Brought into the work context, the art
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>reflected more directly upon them. The height¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>ened emotional reactions caused a strong need
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>to disassociate themselves verbally from the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>picture of womanhood presented in the show.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>While identification with female experiences
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>and values is threatening in any situation in a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l47' n='N047'/>patriarchal society, such identification may be
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>virtually impossible when introduced into a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l49' n='N049'/>work environment dominated by male values
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l50' n='N050'/>and power. Such an environment, by implica¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l51' n='N051'/>tion, and as a condition for the possibility of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l52' n='N052'/>working there, demands a woman&apos;s identifica¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l53' n='N053'/>tion with patriarchy over a recognition of her
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l54' n='N054'/>own oppression. To admit that what was ex¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l55' n='N055'/>pressed in the art is real—women&apos;s powerless¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l56' n='N056'/>ness and powerfulness, their sexual feelings and
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l57' n='N057'/>experiences, and the fact that women are rape
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l58' n='N058'/>victims—is to shatter the very myth that has
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l59' n='N059'/>sustained traditional womanhood all along. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l60' n='N060'/>admitting publicly to an embarrassing, private
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l61' n='N061'/>part of woman&apos;s experience, which she has
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1l62' n='N062'/>attempted to conceal even from herself in an
