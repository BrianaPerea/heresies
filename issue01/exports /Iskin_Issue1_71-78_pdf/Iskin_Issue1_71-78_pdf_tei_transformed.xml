				tion of womanhood is a challenge to all these
				values that allow war, dehumanization, rape,

         </p>
         <p>Faith Wilding elaborated on the relation be¬
				tween personal and political change:
				It has always been a tenet of the feminist
				movement that the personal is political. It is
				political because when a person becomes
				transformed, enters into public experience,
				and infuses her own experience into the public,
				the world becomes transformed for her, but in
				addition she then has the possibility of trans¬
				forming the world.... We have witnessed too
				many people who are in politics who have
				never experienced any kind of personal change
				or real vision....
			</p>
         <p>What specifically triggered the controversy?
				The art in the exhibition included a wide range
				of feminist work: parodies on public images of
				women (Helen Alm Roth and Carole Caroom¬
				pas); private images of women and interior
				spaces (Margaret Neilson); women's self-images
				integrated with their historical and mythologi¬
				cal references (Judy Chicago and Faith Wilding);
				references to women's vulnerability, powerless¬
				ness, and powerfulness (Astrid Preston); relics
				of admired female figures as magic talismans
				(Hazel Slawson); communal efforts (Maria
				Karras); and the quilt/grid pattern and color
				pink seen as tributes to women's collaborative
				forms (Sheila de Bretteville).
				In her tableau environment<hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;"> Remnants in</hi>
            <hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">Homage to Lily Bart from Edith Wharton's</hi>
            <hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">House of Mirth</hi>, Nancy Youdelman "recon¬
				structed" a scene from the book with theatrical
				grandeur and presence. The tableau represents
				the climax of Wharton's novel, when Lily Bart,
				having lost her wealth and status, kills herself.
				Hauntingly life-like, her full-size figure, bearing
				the artist's own features, reclines in bed. Her
				skin tone is grayish and the sleeping drops that
				caused her death are by the side of her bed. The
				floor is cluttered with remnants of her life:
				letters, photographs, delicate laces, dresses,
				corsets, and veils. Youdelman creates metaphors
				(sleep, passivity, death) for what have been
				essential aspects of female experience: eco¬
				nomic dependence on others lack of ultimate
				control over one's own life, victimization by
				circumstances. In the guise of a 19th-century
				tragedy, Lily Bart's story is emblematic for
				women who have remained powerless in
				society.
				In Youdelman's photographic series<hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;"> Leaves: A</hi>
            <hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">Self Portrait, </hi>the artist is lying on the ground,

         <p>It represented ways I felt; I felt numb all over,
				or like a sleepwalker, something that could just
				disappear, and I think that is that powerless¬
				ness in female experience, sleep. There is also
				something esthetic about it; 1 love the color of
				the leaves; it is about death and one could
				suppose that it might also mean renewal....
			</p>
         <p>Youdelman treads on precarious ground in pre¬
				senting the passive female figure, lying uncon¬
				scious, as horizontal female figures have so
				often been used in the history of (male) art to
				entice the spectator by reminding him of his
				vertical superiority. However, Youdelman's tab¬
				leau successfully evokes the solemn empathy of
				the viewer, who is confronted with the <hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">victim's</hi>feelings about her powerlessness.
				In Jan Lester's tableau environment—<hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">Cats</hi>
            <hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">Enamoured Kits: Helpless Tom and Merciless</hi>
            <hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">Sex Kitten </hi>(1974)—two cats are anthropomor¬
				phized to enact a sexual-encounter scene. The
				human environment, dress and behavior pat¬
				terns throw into relief the stereotyped patterns
				of men and women, only the roles are reversed.
				The female cat plays the determined "attacker,"
				the seducer, while the male cat withdraws with
				some apprehension. At the same time, Lester
				sees her work as a manifestation of how women
				are perceived when they take an active role in a
				situation:
				The tableau had to do with sexual politics
				and with the female taking power. It goes far¬
				ther than just one sexual encounter, it goes out
				into the world in general. It is <hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">one</hi> situation like
				a snapshot that makes it clear that this goes on
				in all situations in society.

         <p>Sherie Scheer's series—<hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">Heavenly Visions</hi>—
				depicts Fragonard-inspired images of her own
				baby as a cherub floating in an infinite blue
				California sky. "Wherever they go, they have no
				choice in it.... The heavenly vision in which
				they appear is both ideal and it is limbo." This
				reflects Scheer's own experience as a first-time
				mother:
				I found the child very sensual. It was unex¬
				pected to me what a strong female biological
				experience it was to have a child, and then to be
				absolutely in love with the child. In the course
				of using her as model, however, I made her
				cry, sometimes neglected her, and in a way I
				<hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">used</hi> her, both as a model and as inspiration.
				... I was aware that the art that makes it in
				L.A., or made it at the time (two years ago) was
				non-image-oriented and I am very image¬
				oriented. I was also entirely aware that show¬
				ing babies in one's art was really outrageous,
				and it gave me a devilish pleasure, because I
				think that a lot of art that makes it is empty
				formula and doesn’t have any blood in it; it is
				not daring and it is not a turn-on either. So it
				was like breaking a taboo, and especially for a
				woman artist.
				Like Scheer Gilah Hirsch deals with female
				power within its traditional domain. She uses
				the imagery of food as "a secret biography, a
				metaphorical code."
			</p>
         <p>The shape and color of food itself was so com¬
				pletely right and ripe for my own feelings that
				it became a symbol for me; especially the
				tomato, strawberry, and egg became symbols
				for myself. These are expressed in scale and
				potency; it is a strange word to use in relation¬
				ship to an egg, a potent egg.... The strawberry
				is one of the few fruits that carries its seed on
				the outside, it is a vulnerable fruit; it is juicy
				and has strength and vulnerability at the same
				time.... Rather than feminist, these paintings
				are, I think, more expressive of femaleness. It
				was a personal statement for me.... l can't
				separate my experience from a female experi¬
				ence; I feel powers in me, very specifically in
				certain centers in me.

         <p>The traditional representation of rape in art
				(with the exception of Kollwitz<hi rend="fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;">8</hi>) represents the
				experience of the rapist by focusing on his
				strength, activity and beauty, and further re¬
				moves rape from a realistic experience through
				mythological disguise. Lacy first forces the
				viewer to enact a metaphorical rape ("deflower¬
				ing" the book by tearing the sticker) and then
				confronts the viewer with what rape means to
				its victim.
				In Karen Carson's drawings of beds (1971-75)
				woman <hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">is</hi> the bed. The drawings are expression¬
				istic in style and imagery, powerful as well as
				satirical statements about the myth of happi¬
				ness in sexual relationships. In this case, too,
				the "disturbing“ feminist content of Carson's
				drawings arises from the art-historical tradition
				of reclining female figures on beds and sofas.
				Many of these women become an integral part
				of the inanimate, passive, yet sexually inviting
				surface on which they are reclining. Unlike
				males, Carson identifies with the oppressed¬
				the woman/bed—and at the same time, as art¬
				ist, she takes active charge of that surface, pen¬
				etrates it with a giant screw (<hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">Screw</hi>), converts it
				into a carton of eggs (<hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">Easy Lay</hi>), severs it with a
				saw blade (Edge of Night), or crowns it with a
				giant camera (<hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">Easy Shot</hi>).
				These surreal visualizations are take-offs on
				popular puns, which function as titles and were
			</p>
         <p>often the starting points for the drawings. The
				series began as a macabre though humorous
				comment on popular sexist consumerism. What
				emerges is a violent denunciation of sexual
				roles, until finally the bed—former haven of
				consumer pleasure—disintegrates from within
				(<hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">Cracking Up</hi> and <hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">Shattered Dreams</hi>), smashing
				any illusions we might still have about bed and
				woman. In these most recent drawings the for¬
				merly inanimate object erupts uncontrollably,
				and its fragments fly into space. What is com¬
				monly labeled Women's Liberation is in fact, as
				Carson expresses it, an excruciatingly painful
				process beginning with the recognition of exte¬
				rior oppression, leading to the experience of
				oppression from within, and finally building
				toward a complex re-integration—represented
				by the artist's new work—collages in which the
				torn and mutilated fragments are reunited on a
				cohesive surface.
				I would say that these drawings were intention¬
				ally propagandistic. It had to do with con¬
				sumer and sexual politics. The frame of
				mind that I was in when I did these drawings
				was severe frustration over treatment by men.
				... The drawings were also politically charged
				for me because I talked about them to all kinds
				of groups from Valley housewives to a con¬
				tinuation high school culture-hour class; I
				thought people would be bored by these draw¬

			</p>
         <p>ings and they weren’t. They seemed to have a
				good time, and related to the drawings im¬
				mediately. Now, it is not necessary to have a
				good time when viewing art, but there was
				blanket recognition of the issues.
				When I looked in the newspaper I noticed
				that you could apply sexual politics, directly or
				indirectly, to almost every image in the adver¬
				tisement world; every image implies sexual
				promises. My original fantasy was that I would
				have enough money to take out a full page ad
				in the <hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">L.A. Times,</hi> and just change the images
				a little bit. Obviously the most political thing
				about that was my fantasy about how many
				people I could reach that way. It is the nature
				of good political art to be recognizable and
				understandable by a lot of people and maybe
				at a visceral level too.... Political art is often
				satirical, and probably most effective at that
				level.
				The exhibition provided an opportunity to
				witness the heightened impact of contemporary
				feminist art when viewed by a "non-art“ audi¬
				ence—a cross-section of middle America that
				normally would not encounter art, and specifi¬
				cally by a female audience alienated from femi¬
				nism. (The negative response came primarily
				from women <hi rend="fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;">9</hi>) It can also be seen as a test case
				for implementing a long-desired goal —bringing
				art into a public daily work environment.
				Had the show at Aerospace been exhibited in
				any number of established or alternative gallery
				spaces, it probably would not have caused un¬
				usual debate, and certainly it would not have
				prompted any doubt about the artistic merit of
				the work.<hi rend="fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;">!0</hi> In the Cafeteria Conference Rooms
				of Aerospace, however, the exhibit infiltrated a
				male environment that ordinarily would not dis¬
				play women's work made from a feminist per¬
				spective and certainly would not give it public
				acclaim. The work was predominantly consid¬
				ered scandalous; it engendered passionate ob¬
				jections and firm negative judgments. The show
				was labeled <hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">pornography</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">art</hi> by
				people who were unlikely ever to have consid¬
				ered what is or isn’t art.
				This disclaimer was the protesters' attempt to
				dismiss such threatening and upsetting mate¬
				rial. Casting it as pornography implied that the
				art lacked any real esthetic value and therefore
				need not be taken seriously. The level of naive¬
				té of the critical responses—when opposed to
				the more sophisticated criticism to which we
				are accustomed from much of the art world¬
				was refreshing in its directness. One letter of
				protest stated:
				1 object to the Art Exhibition. ... 1 find it de¬
				grading. As a woman, and hopefully a lady, I
				find it extremely offensive.... I am unable to
				lower my sights to the gutter level of this ex¬
				hibit. In my opinion, it is lewd, vulgar obscene
				and immoral. Since when did good taste and
				modesty go out-of-style?<hi rend="fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;">11</hi>
         </p>
         <p>In another letter, signed by 36 people—
				almost a petition —the art was called:
				... in poor taste, bad character, and a definite
				infringement on the rights of all women and
				men who give sex the dignity, respect and
				honor that was intended for the human race.
				The Aerospace Corporation has drastically
				changed its practices since the 1960s to allow
				this type of "smut“ to be exhibited, and the
				employees were encouraged through desk-to¬
				desk distribution and advertising to view the
				exhibition.
				We are sure that with much less expense to
				the Company, the representatives... could
				have arranged for a display of pornography,
				pictures and books from one of the adult book¬
				stores in the Los Angeles Area, and at a lower
				insurance premium....The Aerospace Wom¬
				en's Committee does not speak for all of the
				female employees, as there are those of us who
				still adhere to the old principle that we were
				liberated immediately when we were born in
				America, we enjoy being treated as a woman,
				and we are definitely Miss or Mrs. and not Ms.<hi rend="fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;">12</hi>Clearly these female viewers at Aerospace
				"saw" in the art their own worst fears of femi¬
				nism. Their objections though focused on the
				exhibition, were rooted in their alienation from
				the organized women’s movement. Confronted
				by art that dealt with an oppression familiar in
				most of their lives, real images that did not
				correspond to the illusion of the American
				dream presented a powerful threat.
				The art was perceived as offensive precisely
				because it was not placed in a neutralizing en¬
				vironment like a gallery, where viewers can
				easily hide behind anonymity. The art invaded
				their own daily working sphere where it threat¬
				ened how they were viewed in their professional
				positions. Brought into the work context, the art
				reflected more directly upon them. The height¬
				ened emotional reactions caused a strong need
				to disassociate themselves verbally from the
				picture of womanhood presented in the show.
				While identification with female experiences
				and values is threatening in any situation in a
				patriarchal society, such identification may be
				virtually impossible when introduced into a
				work environment dominated by male values
				and power. Such an environment, by implica¬
				tion, and as a condition for the possibility of
				working there, demands a woman's identifica¬
				tion with patriarchy over a recognition of her
				own oppression. To admit that what was ex¬
				pressed in the art is real—women's powerless¬
				ness and powerfulness, their sexual feelings and
				experiences, and the fact that women are rape
				victims—is to shatter the very myth that has
				sustained traditional womanhood all along. It is
				admitting publicly to an embarrassing, private
				part of woman's experience, which she has
				attempted to conceal even from herself in an
				effort to preserve the "human dignity" of which
