				<persName>Carol Muske</persName>
				Who the hell am l anyway
				Not to bow?
				(Assata Shakur/Joanne Chesimard)
			</head>
         <p>In July 1973 I wrote an article for The Village
				Voice about a hunger strike then taking place at
				the Women's House of Detention (New York
				City Correctional Institution for Women, hous¬
				ing around 400 detention and sentenced wom¬
				en) on Riker's Island. I used a pseudonym for
				the article because I was working at the time at
				the prison as a mental health worker as well as
				teaching a poetry class, and I wanted to keep
				both occupations. Many of the women in my
				class were involved in the strike and were em¬
				phatic about the significance of their stand,
				although traditionally women at Riker's were
				notoriously apolitical, even downright reaction¬
				ary. Strikes had taken place before, but on is¬
				sues such as cosmetics (the women had wanted
				an Avon lady), more dances and recreation time
				or flashier products in commissary.
				This strike was different. The women were
				demanding, among other things, a legal library,
				an end to massive and lax prescription of "diag¬
				nostic" medication, decent food, and limitation
				of solitary confinement to three days. At the
				Women's House, where an old adage ran "all
				riots end at mealtime," this was pretty heady
				stuff.
				The article in The Village Voice (July 26, 1973)
				was supposed to get the world (or at least Man¬
				hattan) listening and to familiarize people with
				a woman’s situation in prison:
				incarceration for women is a somewhat
				different experience than it is for men. Male
				prisoners are expected to be political in one
				form or another, they are far better legally
				informed, and an atmosphere of "bonding" is
				prevalent. (They are also considered more
				"trainable"—more vocational rehab programs
				exist for men on Riker's Island.)
			</p>
         <p>The administration broke the back of the
				strike in its sixth day by separating the ringlead¬
				ers, transferring them to different housing
				areas, or locking them in the "bing" (solitary).
				But it was too late. The article appeared and
				provoked a reaction from the community: pres¬
				sure was put on the warden. A few of the wom¬
				en’s demands were met: a legal library was es¬
				tablished, kitchen conditions were improved,
				and other steps were taken. Someone from the
				class hand-printed a sign and put it up in
				the classroom: WORDS CAN TURN THEM
				AROUND.
			</p>
         <p>This was a milestone. I had been teaching
				the class for about a year and felt that although
				the women's response had been overwhelming¬
				ly enthusiastic, I was getting nowhere in the
				actual teaching of writing. It wasn’t that the
				women were intimidated by the act of writing.
				Far from it. They wrote to keep mentally alive,
				to keep sane. When I first suggested the idea of
				a writing workshop to the warden, she scoffed
				at it. "These women don’t write," she said.
				"They don’t read. The overall educational level
				is poor. Reading, writing, comprehension... all
				very low." At the first class, I learned that all the
				women "wrote"—they came to class lugging
				diaries, journals, manuscripts full of long
				poems, ballads, stories. Everyone had a poem
				to "tell“; poetry was a tradition; poems were
				written, read, copied by hand, and passed
				around—a publishing network. No one owned a
				poem. All the poems rhymed, and all were
				either sentimental love/religious verse or politi¬
				cal rhetoric. My failure had been the inability to
				let them see alternatives: a poem was not
				always an escape, a fantasy, or a slogan, but a
				way into yourself, an illumination. Somehow
				the article, which was about them, about their
				very real lives in clear, simple language, did it.
				Someone said that a poem could be like report¬
				ing on your life, telling the story of your life—
				journalism of the soul.
				They tried out this approach. Millie Moss,
				who sat all day in front of the television watch¬
				ing commercials about getting away from it all
				and listening to the planes (one every three
				minutes) take off from La Guardia a few hun¬
				dred yards across the water from the prison,
				wrote the first. (Millie had been a "hearts and
				flowers" verse writer: her poems were filled with
				giggly sunsets“):
				Fly Me, l'm Mildred
				Finger my earring as I lean low
				over your bomber cocktail
				I've been known
				to put you on a throne
				send you off alone (not united)
				through the tomb-boom roar
				you get what you’re asking for
				when you fly me, honey,
				l'm Mildred.

         <p>Personally
				So you spoke to me in silence
				in the ice man's choir
				and I dangled all the while
				You said (in silence)
				live each day
				spittin' on Fifth Avenue
				fox-trottin' in hell..
				So we ain’t home—
				we’re together
				Smile:
				I take it personally
			</p>
         <p>They were on fire. I told them about Mandel¬
				stam, Dostoyevsky, the long tradition of writers
				in prison. I read them poems. Another woman,
				Elizabeth Powell, came to class with a poem
				about homosexuality which was explicit, hon¬
				est, and skillfully done. The class praised it¬
				Elizabeth left the class that night, made a sheaf
				of copies by hand, and passed it "on the vine."
				The next time I arrived at the prison, I was
				called into the warden’s office. A member of my
				class, the warden said, had written a poem
				about her "unique perversion" and had implied,
				she said, that there were also correction offi¬
				cers who were homosexual, one in particular.
				She spoke of libel, telling me that I should have
				confiscated the poem immediately, or at least
				made sure that it didn’t go beyond the class.
				(Though homosexuality was indeed common—
				the "only game" in the prison, the warden
				steadfastly refused to admit that she had any
				more than-a few "deviants" on her hands, whom
				she described as hard-core—in other words, gay
				even on the outside. Actually, as is the case in
				most women's prisons, homosexual relation¬
				ships were standard even for straights, for the
				simple reason that human beings need physical
				intimacy and affection when they are confined
				to correctional institutions and cut off from
				relationships available to them outside the walls.
				Definitions of personal sexuality tend to
				change behind bars. Upon release, some
				women remain "changed," while the majority
				of former prisoners return to heterosexual life¬
				styles. The warden deeply feared homosexuality;
				any manifestation of "butch" conduct was
				enough to tag an inmate a troublemaker and
				"male attire" was expressly forbidden in the
				rules guide. Correction officers were warned
				not to wear pants to work, and thus their uni¬
				form remained skirted. (Although many C.O.'s
				were, in fact, gay, the atmosphere reflected the
				warden's artificial notion of femininity.
				After this incident, I was informed that the
				poem had been confiscated and that Elizabeth
				Powell had been placed in solitary confinement
			</p>
         <p>pending a hearing by the disciplinary board. I
				was told that I would be allowed to continue
				the poetry class for the time being, but that if
				another incident like this took place, I would be
				asked to leave the prison. The warden sincerely
				hoped that I had "learned a lesson."
				I had. It was just as I had told them: a dra¬
				matic testimony to the power of words—and,
				thought, one of the stupidest things I have ever
				done. It was easy for me to drop in and talk
				about "getting it down right“ and being honest
				in writing—I went home every night. For me,
				there was no danger of being thrown in solitary,
				having my personal papers raided, or worse. It
				occurred to me that even when l had written my
				ever-so-honest article, I had used a pseud¬
				onym to protect myself. There were obviously
				bigger risks than job loss at stake for women or
				men who chose to write while incarcerated;
				risks l had clearly not understood. Words could
				indeed turn around the authorities, but could
				also turn them into the oppressors they actually
				were.
				Elizabeth Powell was in the bing for three
				weeks. When she came back to class, she was
				ready to go another round (she had written 25
				poems, all dealing with homosexuality, while in
				lock), but I had made a decision. I explained
				how I felt as an outsider with no right to tell
				them how to write in this volatile situation, but
				I asked that they make a distinction between
				public and private poems to protect themselves
				from exactly this kind of censorship/punish¬
				ment. Private poems were, obviously, ones you
				could get thrown in the bing for; public poems
				could be "published." At this point, I also went
				back to the warden and told her she should not
				be surprised at some "emotional" poems; I
				described the class as "therapy" and she agreed
				that that was a good way of viewing it.
				The class flourished. The women began to
				express themselves, to find words underneath
				and in the midst of the gloss of everyday lan¬
				guage. Some discovered (recovered?) a sub¬
				terranean language like subway graffiti: the
				poem became a Kilroy, a zap: "I was here."
				I had quit my mental health worker job and
				was concentrating on expanding FREE SPACE,
				as the class had come to be called. The NEA had
				given us some funding, as did Poets &amp; Writers
				and some local banks. Linda Stewart of The
				Book-of-the-Month Club mailed boxes of over¬
				stocked paperback books; we amassed our own
				library and Ted Slate of Newsweek donated sup¬
				plies and equipment.
				Tom Weatherly taught a second poetry class,
				Gail Rosenblum taught fiction, and Fannie
				James, an ex-inmate, ex-student of the Space
				whom the warden actually allowed to come
				back to work with us, taught poetry and library
				skills. Each teacher learned to cope in his or her
				own way with the trials of trying to run a writing
				class in a prison. Each class was like a hypothet¬
				ical leap: it would take place 1) IF the officer in

         <p>the housing area remembered to announce it;
				2) IF the women were there and not a) in court
				b) in solitary c) in another part of the prison
				d) watching television e) sleeping and/or
				drugged f) transferred to another floor g) trans-
				ferred to another prison h) out on bail (good
				news); 3) IF the officer on hall duty okayed the
				passes; 4) IF the warden had not scheduled
				something else in your classroom (usually a
				course in etiquette); 5) IF there was no "contra¬
				band," i.e., spiral notebooks (the wire is a
				potential weapon), chewing gum (jams locks),
				tweezers, or snap-top pens (another weapon—
				only ball points or pencils allowed).
				Somehow, the class took place and thrived.
				Visitors came to read and comment on student
				work: poets Mae Jackson, Daniela Gioseffi,
				Daniel Halpern, Audre Lorde. For a long time,
				everyone learned. Information was taken in,
				absorbed—classes were spent writing and re¬
				writing, letting off steam.
				Almost four years later, most of the women
				from the old class had been transferred or freed
				(detention women often spend two years wait¬
				ing for trial), but emphasis was still placed on
				getting along." We all stressed writing as craft.
				Classes were run as any outside workshop would
				be, except no one ever published anything.
				The poetry class at this time was full of
				women who were considered potential security
				threats—in other words, intelligent, outspoken,
				and funny. Some were "controversial" cases:
				Juanita Reedy, about to have her first child
				behind bars; Carole Ramer who had been
				busted with Abbie Hoffman and who had a lot
				to say about everything; Gloria Jensen, whose
				imagination was like a vaudeville show; Assata
				Shakur/Joanne Chesimard—alleged leader of
				the Black Liberation Army, brilliant and tal¬
				ented, with a Cool-Hand Luke aura of insou¬
				ciance, compassion, and tenacity. (Assata was
				considered so dangerous that the prison re¬
				quired her to have a continual guard-escort.)
				These women were all good writers. They had
				learned craft and practiced it—and wanted
				more. They wanted to go further than "thera¬
				peutic" writing or workshop poems. They were
				writing dynamite.
				After four years, there was a huge pile of
				handwritten poems, Fannie's log with the names
				of every woman who had come to class, some
				incredible memories, and that was all. We went
				to the prison week after week and no one ever
				saw or heard what the women wrote: the voices
				were never heard outside, and on the inside,
				only in class. I began to feel that something had
				to give—no matter what risks were involved for
				the women (if they should decide to publish)¬
				and for FREE SPACE as a writing program. It was
				Catch 22—we were losing either way. At this
				stage, the women were denied the natural ful¬
				fillment of self-expression, which is publication.
				If we published their writing, however, we stood
			</p>
         <p>to lose the writing program itself. I began to
				fantasize about getting the word out: if people
				could only hear some of this stuff, I thought, no
				one would ever ask me again about either the
				quality of prisoners' writing or the reasons for
				running workshops in prisons. We would have
				evidence in writing. Best of all, the women
				would have the audience they deserved. I began
				to draft a rough script, a framework for some of
				the poems.
				What happened to Juanita Reedy made up
				everybody's mind about publication. Juanita
				went to Elmhurst Hospital to have her child and
				was treated so inhumanely that she refused to
				let prison doctors touch her upon her return.
				She wrote a poem about her experience, which
				she developed into a longer "Birth Journal." She
				published it in Majority Report, the feminist
				journal. In the same issue there was an article
				about FREE SPACE and a poem by Carole Ramer.
				The issue began to circulate in the prison.
				Assata, inspired by Juanita, wrote her own
				"Birth Journal" and sent it to a major magazine.
				One night in class she read this poem:
				Butch
				You should have told me
				About your dick
				Stashed inside your bureau drawer
				woulda believed you
				Ya say ya wanna be my daddy
				Va say ya wanna be my daddy
				Ya say ya wanna be my daddy
				Yeah! Run it! l'm ready!
				My mamma warned me about you
				She taught me about you
				She beat me about you
				But I thought you were a man.
				And I lower my eyes
				And I lower my back
				And I swivel my hips
				And I lighten my voice
				And I powder my nose
				And I blue up my eyes
				And I redden my cheeks
				And I jump when you call
				And I cook and I knit
				And I clean and I sew
				And it is all so cozy
				You lying in my arms
				(If I am not being too forward,
				too unladylike)
				But who will know, anyway,
				That you were in my arms
				Not me in yours

         <p>And if it comes to it
				To save face
				You can lie
				l'Il back you up
				l've gotten very good at it lately
				You should have told me
				About your status—
				I would have bowed to you
				What's one more bow, anyway?
				I bow to the dollar
				I bow to the scholar
				I bow to the white house
				I bowto the church mouse
				I bow to tradition
				I bow to contrition
				I bow to the butcher
				I bow to the baker
				I bow to the goddamn
				lightbulb maker—
				Who the hell am l anyway
				Not to bow?
				What else do I know how to do?
				But you should have told me baby
				You should have hipped me momma
				I didn’t know you would pull it out
				And strap it on
				Fucking me mercilessly
				Long stroking me
				So that even my shadow is moaning
				But damn baby
				I didn't know
				You coulda saved me the trip¬
				I thought I was on my way
				To a garden
				Where fruit ain’t forbidden
				Where snakes do not crawl to seduce
				I thought for a second
				That earth was a good thing
				That acting had played out
				And cotillions were outlawed
				That bingo was over
				And ladies had drowned in their tea
				But now that l'm hip momma
				Come, fuck me.
				(Assata Shakur/Joanne Chesimard)
				Some of Assata’s poems were accepted for
				publication in, a literary magazine. Poets &amp;
				Writers gave us a grant to do an anthology of
				students' writing which Gail and I compiled. We
				published it through the Print Center in Brook¬
				lyn and called it Songs from a Free Space: Writ-
			</p>
         <p>ings by Women in Prison. The anthology was
				sold in New York bookstores and distributed to
				the women in the classes. It contained some of
				the best work done in the classes.
				By now I had handed over a rough script to
				the poetry class and an idea about doing some
				kind of theater piece. The women put together
				a revue of loosely scripted poems, songs, and
				vignettes called Next Time. They memorized
				lines and improvised costumes. Karen Sander¬
				son, a friend and videotape expert, arrived at
				the prison one Sunday with a crew of women
				(after endless haggling for permission; we told
				the Corrections Department that we needed the
				videotape as a rehearsal tool for a play) and
				taped for nine hours straight. Finally, after
				months of editing, a half-hour tape emerged
				which documents the poems, songs, love, and
				exasperation of some of these incredible wom¬
				en. (This tape is available to anyone interested.)
				In September 1975, FREE SPACE merged with
				ART WITHOUT WALLS, another arts project for
				women in prison. Now we were able to offer
				graphic arts and dance, in addition to having a
				larger staff. The publishing idea had fulfilled
				itself, a renaissance. Juanita had begun a book
				about her experiences; another woman, Isabelle
				Newton, was collecting her poems in manu¬
				script. Then Assata, who had been held in soli¬
				tary for one year in New Jersey, whose cell was
				raided by guards every day in search of contra¬
				band, and who had been beaten by the prison
				goon squad on numerous occasions, completed
				her book of poems and wrote two chapters of a
				book, an account of her arrest and life in prison.
				The warden stopped me in the hall one day and
				told me that she knew we were collaborating on
				a book with Assata and Juanita. She told me she
				hadn’t forgotten the Elizabeth Powell case.
				On November 26, 1975, Gail was preparing to
				leave home to go to her fiction class (filled with
				new students) when the phone rang. It was Dep¬
				uty Freeman, the WHD Program Director, who
				advised her not to come to class: the program
				had been cancelled. We were not allowed to do
				anything after that except to pick up our books
				and any program belongings; we couldn’t say
				good-bye to anyone or discuss plans for any of
				their work.
				Naturally, we are contesting this decision,
				but there isn’t much hope in appealing a war¬
				den’s whim. It is, after all, her turf. Official
				reasons for the cancellation were said to be
				duplication of services (they stated that the
				public school provided the same type of classes)
				and irregularity of classes. The warden refused,
				however to put these reasons in writing for us.
				It is clear that the writing classes were taken
				seriously only when the women wrote seriously
				about their lives and published those writings.
				Poetry is safe, women are safe until they begin
				to make sense and communicate. Still, ART

         <p>recognizes the possibilities of self-expression,
				perhaps the walls crack a little. Perhaps. Words
				can, indeed, turn them around, but sometimes
				having all the right words is small change.
				"Before despairing, speak of it," said a wom¬
				an one day in class. Even when writing of
				despair there’s the fact—named and held to
				the light for a moment—maybe even under¬
				stood.
				WITHOUT WALLS/FREE SPACE is continuing to
				work at a children’s center, a drug clinic, and
				another women’s prison. It’s important to main¬
				tain the lifelines between people on the outside
				and those inside.
				But what happened at the Women's House of
				Detention can easily happen again. Especially if
				publishing is, as it should be, part of the writing
				project. Prison writers have a right to be heard
				as does any writer. Their voices are too impor¬
				tant to be missed. Publishing is part of the art of
				not bowing. Each time a man or woman in a cell
