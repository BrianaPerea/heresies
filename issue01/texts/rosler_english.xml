				<p> I first came across when 1 was 22. It was 6 months since ! came to Tijuana from
					my village. There was little work and my sister had friends who were working as
					maids in San Diego, and she was sure it would be easy to arrange —1 would leave
					Rosita and Juanito with her and she would help me find out how to get across the
					border and get a job. l'd rather not discuss the details of how 1 got here.
					There were men who demanded a lot of money from me, but they promised to get me
					a job right away and a green card later. But ! never got the card. They wanted
					5350 for a fake one, but those usually don’t get past the inspectors. I signed a
					paper saying l would give them half my salary for 3 months, and they took me
					across. All over Tijuana there are men with beautiful, shiny American cars,
					waiting, promising jobs. They take hundreds, thousands of women across every
					year. I didn't know this then.</p>

				<p>I was terrified — was sure l'd be caught, and 1 was also very afraid to go to a
					foreign country. Iknew only a few words of English. How lonely l'd be,
					especially without my kids! Many women cross every day with the mica, a pass
					only for shopping. They take the Greyhound to downtown San Diego and then take a
					city bus to work. The Greyhound is very expensive, almost 51. l heard someone
					say that the city wanted to have a bus to the border for 259, but Grey¬ hound
					got the court to stop them. If 1 went across every day I could be with my kids
					at night, but the ones who do that are always tired¬ working for the patrona all
					day and caring for their families at night. But anyway, the men said 1 could
					only get a job living in with a family. It would pay less but at least !
					wouldn’t have to pass the border, with its inspectors, every day. They are
					unpredictable, like aguars; they let you pass every day, every week, and then
					all of a sudden they take your card away.</p>

				<p>The men got me a job with a very rich family; the boss was a business executive.
					The patrona was kind, really. She showed me how things worked in her house and
					helped me with English. She said she expected that lwould only stay about 8
					months with her, long enough to learn English and how to dress and do my hair,
					sol could get an office job. I was so surprised! 1 was just thanking God to have
					a job. They expected me to work 7 days a week, but when 1 told them about Rosita
					and Juanito they gave me a day and a half off. The woman gave me a book to study
					called Home Maid Spanish Cook Book. The book said, "Our aim is not to teach the
					Mexican or Spanish¬ speaking maid how to make her own native dishes. She can do
					that to perfection and without our help. We want to have her help YOU in the
					kitchen. To do things YOUR way." The book has drawings of an American kitchen
					with everything named in Spanish. This book also gives recipes for typical
					American foods, like Hamburger Sand¬ wiches, Hot Dogs, Tuna Casserole, Steak,
					Meat Loaf, and Apple Pie. It tells how to make things for the bosses' parties,
					like Caviar Crackers, and also how to make drinks. My bosses' favorites were
					Martinis and Old Fashioneds.</p>

				<p>
					<title>Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Sandwich</title> Butter 2 slices of bread.
					Spread one slice generously with peanut butter and top with a layer of jelly.
					Cover with remaining slice of bread; cut in half. Serve with a large glass of
					milk, for a hearty lunch. </p>

				<p> The book has a list of phrases in English and Spanish, like: </p>
				<list>
					<item>Sweep the kitchen floor.</item>
					<item>scrub</item>
					<item>wax and polish</item>
					<item>We like breakfast served at .....</item>
					<item>Have you ever shopped in a supermarket?</item>
				</list>
				<p> etcetera, etcetera, and it has a phrase that I heard often: </p>
				<p> Will you cook a Mexican dinner for us sometime?</p>

				<p>There was a lot to do, with three kids messy like pigs, the huge house, and many
					parties to clean up after. The senora tried to speak to me in Spanish, but her
					accent was so bad that ! could hardly understand her. The sehor hardly spoke to
					me at all, except to ask me when lwas going to make chile con carne, which isn’t
					a Mexican dish, or to ask me when 1 was going to make them some tamales. l'd
					pretend ! didn’t understand. I didn’t want to make tamales for them. didn’t
					expect to do so much cooking, but l would not last if I com¬ plained. So! made
					tacos. I don’t know which ! disliked more, cooking the boring American foods
					they loved or the tacos once a <pb n="12"/> week. My sister told me about a girl
					from our village who was taken to Laguna Beach by a couple to care for their
					children, but all day they had her cooking and cleaning. They had her cook very
					spicy Mexican dishes for their friends, and then they would bring her out to
					show to the guests. She was very young and alone and couldn’t speak English. She
					committed suicide—she killed herself.</p>
				<p>Well, my patrones let me eat what ! wanted when they were done, and I never ate
					so much meat in my lifel ! made 530 a week, half of it went to the men, my room
					was tiny and badly lit, but ! had work, and 1 was eating regularly.</p>

				<p>We settled into a routine and Ifinished paying the men. It was spring and the
					kids were in camp and the patrona went on a visit for a few days. Iwas reading
					in my room one night when the patron knocked on the door. Itold him to wait
					because l'had to get dressed but he came in anyway and leaned over me. 1tried to
					escape, he grabbed me and we struggled. He was trying to kiss me and shove me
					onto the bed. He ripped my underwear. He began to force me but pulled away and
					ran to the bathroom and locked the door. He pounded, almost breaking the door
					and I'began to cry. Even after he stopped 1 was afraid to open the door thinking
					he could be hidden somewhere in the room. Iknew l had no hope of help from the
					police because ! was illegal and because that type of guy has enough money to
					get himself off. Finally l'heard the front door close, the car start up and
					drive away. Iran to my room. I gathered all my things and ran off. I took a bus
					downtown and spent the night waiting for the bus to the border.</p>
				<p>Since that incident l'have met four women who were raped by their bosses; one of
					them was made pregnant. Sol was lucky after all.</p>

				<p>After a while l went back to San Diego with my mica. This time knew to look in
					the newspaper to find a job. 1 got one with a professor and his wife in La
					jolla. They paid me only 325 a week but the house was smaller and there were
					only 2 kids, who spent all their time before the TV. There were many statues and
					paintings and beautiful rugs and much to dust and vacuum. They had a lot of old
					pottery and statues made by the Indians of Mexico. The food was better, they
					appreciated my Mexican food, and sol didn’t mind cooking so much. All these
					gringos want to eat the food of the poor. The wife smiled at me a lot, but she
					spoke to me as though ! were a child or very stupid. They also had all the
					"Spanish Maid" books.</p>
				<p>These people were very bad about paying me. Once they got 5 weeks behind and when
					1 asked them to pay they said they couldn't because they had a lot of bills. got
					angry and told them ! was going to call the police, which was ridiculous because
					they got angry and said they were going to call immigration. I was terrified and
					left the job.</p>

				<p>My next job was also in La Jolla, with a doctor and his family, for 555 a weekl
					Ihad to cook all the meals, take care of the kids, do al the cleaning, and stay
					7 days a week, so l couldn’t see my kids. spent so much money calling them on
					the phonel After almost a year lheard of a Mr. So-and-so who would pay 535 a
					week for someone to live there 5 days a week. He hired 2 of us and made an
					arrangement where we bought all the food with our salaries, we fed and cleaned
					up after him and his friends, and he let us take other jobs during the day. 1
					met some awfully mean people that way. I don’t know which are worse, the ones
					who are real demanding or the kind ones who think they are giving you charity.
					By then 1'had a reputation for making good Mexican food for parties, sol did
					that as well as clean¬ ing for people.</p>

				<p>But 6 weeks ago the senor came into our room while we were undressing and started
					getting fresh, so we left and moved to a cheap hotel downtown. 1 make 5100 a
					week cooking and cleaning for dif¬ ferent people, 6 days a week. That's a lot of
					money, but ! work very hard. And l’m independent.</p>

				<p> Broil the peppers over the fire until the skin blisters. Wrap them in a cloth
					for 10 minutes, then peel them. Slit one side, remove seeds and veins. Leave the
					stems. Stuff them with cheese and raisins. Beat the egg whites until they are

					hour. Put through a sieve. Grind the raisins, nuts, garlic, ginger, and chilis.
					Add to the tomatoes. Add sugar, vinegar, salt. Cook until thick.)</p>

				<p>There is a woman in La Jolla who tried to organize the maids, cooks, and
					gardeners, the legal ones, because even they make less than 52 an hour without
					any job security. If they get sick or their bosses go on vacation there is no
					work. I have even gone to some of their meetings, and it was there that ! found
					out various things. earned that the inspectores no longer pay 550 for
					information about illegals and that they do not care about the women, only the
					men. Some of them have illegal maids themselves. But even so, we all know that
					for each one of us there are hundreds of hungry and desperate people in Mexico
					who would gladly take our jobs for half the pay. Especially now, with such hard
					times. was one of them. Now that l’m independent 1 could have spent more time
					with my kids but two weeks ago my big fear was realized because they took away
					my mica. They took 20 or 30 away from us while ! was there, all at once, without
					asking any questions. They said we would get them back after they were checked,
					but almost never are they returned and now they are hard to get. I missed work
					for days, and finally ! paid 350 to those men with cars. This time they passed a
					bunch of us, one at a time, from one man to the other along the border. There
					were so many snakes that 1 thought l'd get bitten before ! made it across.</p>

				<p>Now l'm looking for a job with a family that will let me bring my kids. Iknow
					l'II make less, but it's worth it. I have a friend who is marrying a gringo she
					does not love, but he wants a good Mexican wife and cook, and he will adopt her
					daughter. I would rather live in Mexico but there is no work by which 1 can
					support myself and my kids.If1 get a job in the U.S. where ! can keep my kids !
					won’t have to face the border troubles. It is true ! will still have the other
					things to worry about, like other people’s messes, or the senoras who ask me,
					sometimes in English and sometimes in Spanish, am 1 going to cook them a Mexican
					dinner? Or like their husbands, who don’t ask but who wish to get from me
					something else. </p>

				in a lower-middle-class milieu. Ihave lived in Manhattan and, for most of the past 8
				years, in California. Much of my work centers on women's roles and occupations,
				particu¬ larly on how consciousness and language reflect social circumstance. I have
				paid special attention to the use of food in the context of affluent bourgeois
