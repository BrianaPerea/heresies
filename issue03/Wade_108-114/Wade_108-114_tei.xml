				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_11' n='N011'/>Protestant. She always wanted C. to speak properly and
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_12' n='N012'/>often corrected her mid-sentence. Even so C. doesn’t

				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_14' n='N014'/>high cheek bones. C. hates to be told she is like her
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_15' n='N015'/>mother though in some ways she is. They both have

				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_17' n='N017'/>1916 in England. C.&apos;s mother M. is British but took
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_18' n='N018'/>American citizenship in 1957. She was raised by her
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_19' n='N019'/>great aunt in Preston, Lancashire, and went to Catholic
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_20' n='N020'/>boarding schools. She had long light blonde hair and the
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_21' n='N021'/>nuns were angry with her when she cropped it short.
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_22' n='N022'/>She liked to ride horses and play cricket. She was

				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_25' n='N025'/>times complained about the trauma of C.’s birth. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_26' n='N026'/>evidently very tiresome and painful. She could not
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_27' n='N027'/>breast feed because of heavy anesthesia. C. weighed a
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_28' n='N028'/>lot when she was born. She had a big head, was fat, and
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_29' n='N029'/>cried a lot.

				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_33' n='N033'/>as her mother’s. K.’s mother K. has grey hair and blue

				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_35' n='N035'/>K. thinks she looks funny. She is Catholic. K. always
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_36' n='N036'/>insists that she looks like her mother K. even though she
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_37' n='N037'/>looks like her father too. K. will reluctantly admit that
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_38' n='N038'/>her legs are bowed like her father’s. K.’s mother K. lives

				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_40' n='N040'/>K.’s mother was born too. K.’s mother K. was born in
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_41' n='N041'/>1924. K.&apos;s mother’s mother was Irish but K.’s mother K.
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_42' n='N042'/>was raised in Buffalo. K.’s mother’s mother was a maid
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_43' n='N043'/>for wealthy families. K.’s mother K. used to go some¬
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_44' n='N044'/>times with her mother and play in the homes of wealthy
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_45' n='N045'/>families. K. was born to her mother K. when she was
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_46' n='N046'/>thirty years old. She is the middle child of five children,
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_47' n='N047'/>two sons and three daughters. K.’s birth was difficult
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_48' n='N048'/>relative to the other children, but she was a medium
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_49' n='N049'/>sized and healthy baby.

				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_2_2' n='N002'/>and forty pounds and has a Brooklyn accent. She speaks
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_3_1' n='N003'/>loudly and is Jewish. She has red curly hair, blue eyes
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_4_1' n='N004'/>and freckles. Her hair used to be bright red but it is
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_5_1' n='N005'/>faded now. R. looks very much like her mother J. but
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_6_1' n='N006'/>she is not as tall and she has blonde hair. R. is sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_7_1' n='N007'/>taken to be her mother over the phone although she
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_8_1' n='N008'/>speaks very softly. R.’s mother J. was born in 1930 in
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_9_1' n='N009'/>Brooklyn, New York. Then she moved to New Jersey by
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_10_1' n='N010'/>way of Queens where she raised her family. When R. s
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_11_1' n='N011'/>mother J. lived in Brooklyn she very much wanted to go
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_12_1' n='N012'/>to the public school but her parents insisted that she go
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_13_1' n='N013'/>to the more prestigious private school. She eventually
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_14_1' n='N014'/>went away to Syracuse University. R. was born to her

				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_17_1' n='N017'/>born. R. s mother J. was in labor with R. a long time but
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_18_1' n='N018'/>her birth was not painful.
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_19_1' n='N019'/>C.’s mother M. has been a secretary and a sales clerk,
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_20_1' n='N020'/>although she had wanted to be a veterinarian. She is
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_21_1' n='N021'/>now a housewife, although she does volunteer work for

				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_23_1' n='N023'/>and French in an adult education program. While she

				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_25_1' n='N025'/>work because wives of officers in the State Department
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_26_1' n='N026'/>were not allowed to work. C.’s mother M. lives in Lon¬

				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_31_1' n='N031'/>before C. was born. When C. was six her mother went
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_32_1' n='N032'/>to work part-time but she didn’t tell anyone that she was
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_33_1' n='N033'/>working for several months because she felt she had to
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_34_1' n='N034'/>prove that she could work and be a good mother too.
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_35_1' n='N035'/>C.’s mother M. always told C. that she could be any¬

				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_37_1' n='N037'/>that C. showed promise of talent. C.’s mother M.
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_38_1' n='N038'/>wanted C. to be a doctor, dancer, scholar, writer, artist,
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_39_1' n='N039'/>linguist, a good wife and happy. Most of all she wanted

				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_41_1' n='N041'/>K.’s mother K. used to go to work sometimes with her
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_42_1' n='N042'/>mother, the domestic servant. This was how she got her
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_43_1' n='N043'/>first jobs babysitting and cleaning. K.’s mother K. was a
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_44_1' n='N044'/>secretary before she was married. After she was married
				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_45_1' n='N045'/>she typed sometimes at home for extra money. She

				<lb facs='#facs_111_region_1675023872210_1792_tl_47_1' n='N047'/>she could buy a bicycle for her daughter. Later K.&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_2' n='N002'/>earn as a carpenter. K.’s mother K. hated the factory.

				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_5' n='N005'/>women who worked there were very masculine and
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_6' n='N006'/>unlike K.’s mother K. K.’s mother K. now works in the
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_7' n='N007'/>Post Office. She worked at night for many years. K.&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_8' n='N008'/>mother K. chose the night shift because she thought she
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_9' n='N009'/>would have more time to spend with her children that
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_10' n='N010'/>way, but the result of this was only that she was per-
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_11' n='N011'/>petually dazed. K. resented that her mother K. had to
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_12' n='N012'/>work so much and couldn’t spend more time with her
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_13' n='N013'/>family. K.’s mother K. is really glad that K. could go to
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_14' n='N014'/>college. It was very important to her that all her children
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_15' n='N015'/>could go to college. She feels better for that.
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_16' n='N016'/>R.’s mother J. left Syracuse University and transferred
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_17' n='N017'/>to Adelphi University when she married so that she
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_18' n='N018'/>could live with her husband in Queens. The single-most
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_19' n='N019'/>motivation for her marriage was her belief that she
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_20' n='N020'/>could not take care of herself, economically or psych¬
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_21' n='N021'/>ologically. Just before she married she wrote to her
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_22' n='N022'/>mother asking her to discourage her from marrying. She
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_23' n='N023'/>did not. R.’s mother J. didn’t work after she was married
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_24' n='N024'/>but started having a family. Later she went to a psychi

				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_26' n='N026'/>years. Six years after starting therapy she got a job as a
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_27' n='N027'/>social worker and went to graduate school at Columbia
				<lb facs='#facs_112_region_1675023893045_1801_tl_28' n='N028'/>in social work. R.’s mother J. likes her job but feels that
