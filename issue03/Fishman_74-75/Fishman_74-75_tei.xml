				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_7' n='N007'/>If you look at history you’ll find that almost every
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_8' n='N008'/>school of painting and every individual artist has redis¬
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_9' n='N009'/>covered artists of the past or discovered new or different
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_10' n='N010'/>aspects of a particular painting or school of painting out
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_11' n='N011'/>of the specific needs of their own work. Need determines
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_12' n='N012'/>invention. The same has to be true of our needs for past
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_13' n='N013'/>art. As my relationship to my subject matter is very per¬
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_14' n='N014'/>sonal, so is my relationship to other painting. If an
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_15' n='N015'/>aspect of paint application in a Cezanne interests me,
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_16' n='N016'/>the fact that I may not have responded to the spatial
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_17' n='N017'/>constructs or use of color is of little consequence. At
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_18' n='N018'/>another time, if those things become important to me, l
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_19' n='N019'/>will go back and look for them.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_20' n='N020'/>I can dislike a painting but find a small part which
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_21' n='N021'/>engages me, a quality of light or some aspect of the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_22' n='N022'/>drawing. These are things which usually find their way
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_23' n='N023'/>into my work, often because I was approaching them in
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_24' n='N024'/>some way already. A found connection in another
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_25' n='N025'/>painting can help crystalize my thought.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_26' n='N026'/>It is important not to judge our own responses to
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_27' n='N027'/>paintings as inappropriate. Any place we deny the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_28' n='N028'/>validity of our thoughts or activities is a place that will
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_29' n='N029'/>weaken our relationship to our art.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_30' n='N030'/>Try not to cut whole bodies of work out of your
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_31' n='N031'/>vision unless you’ve looked at them and studied them
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_32' n='N032'/>thoroughly: don’t stop looking at El Greco because he’s
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_33' n='N033'/>not Jewish, or Chardin because he’s not an abstract
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_34' n='N034'/>painter or Matisse because he’s not a lesbian. By all
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_35' n='N035'/>means look at Agnes Martin and Georgia O’Keefe and
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_36' n='N036'/>Eva Hesse. But don’t forget Cezanne, Manet and Giotto.

				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_38' n='N038'/>painting is what you must look at. Take what you want
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_39' n='N039'/>and leave the dreck.

				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_41' n='N041'/>My experience has been that I need to go through
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_42' n='N042'/>ritual events before my mind is clear and focused
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_43' n='N043'/>enough to work. It involves an hour or two, or some¬
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_44' n='N044'/>times a day or two; of sweeping the floor, talking on the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_45' n='N045'/>phone (not to anyone who could be too distracting or
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_46' n='N046'/>disruptive), keeping a journal, writing a letter, sending
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_47' n='N047'/>off bills, doing some sort of exercise or meditation,
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_48' n='N048'/>sitting quietly and reading or drawing. At certain times
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_49' n='N049'/>music has been very distracting.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_50' n='N050'/>You have to learn what is helpful and what begins to

				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_1_2' n='N001'/>if I only have a little time to work, I try to compress
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_2_2' n='N002'/>some ritual loosening up into that time. Without the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_3_2' n='N003'/>ritual I sabatoge myself. It’s important that these activi¬

				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_5_2' n='N005'/>After l’ve gone through this process, I try to take the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_6_1' n='N006'/>painting by surprise. I begin as if accidentally (although
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_7_1' n='N007'/>all the while I have been sneaking glances at the work).
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_8_1' n='N008'/>Anything in my vision can be as distracting as noise or
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_9_1' n='N009'/>an emotional interruption.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_10_1' n='N010'/>Some people say you must have no thoughts about
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_11_1' n='N011'/>other people or other things while you are working.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_12_1' n='N012'/>often have a rush of imaginary conversations with
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_13_1' n='N013'/>people, ideas that fill the room. But I don’t stop
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_14_1' n='N014'/>working. They allow me to unhinge my unconscious. I
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_15_1' n='N015'/>don’t look for those conversations, but I let them
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_16_1' n='N016'/>happen. As I get excited about an image forming, I am
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_17_1' n='N017'/>often also engaged in what seems to be a totally separate
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_18_1' n='N018'/>thought
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_19_1' n='N019'/>Once l’ve started working, the important thing is to
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_20_1' n='N020'/>keep myself in the studio, despite the fact that I invent
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_21_1' n='N021'/>lots of reasons why 1 must leave at that precise moment.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_22_1' n='N022'/>When l’ve set up a day for painting, there is no pressing
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_23_1' n='N023'/>activity anywhere, unless 1 construct it on the spot.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_24_1' n='N024'/>Sometimes, leaving the studio has to happen. It&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_25_1' n='N025'/>never too clear until later whether l’m coping or copping
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_26_1' n='N026'/>out. As l’m about to leave the studio, l’m often more
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_27_1' n='N027'/>able to work than before. The brain gives up hugging
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_28_1' n='N028'/>itself into nonmovement and 1 am free to work again for
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_29_1' n='N029'/>a while. This is often the time when I do my best work.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_30_1' n='N030'/>But there are times when that little joy that happens in
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_31_1' n='N031'/>working disappears for weeks. And I am suffering,
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_32_1' n='N032'/>making what seems like endlessly boring, ugly, unin¬
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_33_1' n='N033'/>spired forms. I can’t draw worth shit. Everything has
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_34_1' n='N034'/>become awkward. I feel like l’ve made a terrible mistake
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_35_1' n='N035'/>being a painter. And this goes on for weeks and weeks.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_36_1' n='N036'/>The only thing that gets me through is a lot of complain¬
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_37_1' n='N037'/>ing to a friend or my lover. I need them to encourage me
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_38_1' n='N038'/>into believing that I really am a painter and my troubles
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_39_1' n='N039'/>are temporary.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_40_1' n='N040'/>The other thing that helps is knowing from past
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_41_1' n='N041'/>experience that this is the time of the hardest struggle
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_42_1' n='N042'/>and is usually the time when I learn the most about
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_43_1' n='N043'/>painting. And my memory is suddenly very short, like
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_44_1' n='N044'/>this is the first time this has ever happened to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_45_1' n='N045'/>This is the most important time to stay with the work.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_46_1' n='N046'/>Then there’s a short time when something changes, a
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_47_1' n='N047'/>painting or an idea evolves and there is a little relief in
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_48_1' n='N048'/>the air. The work is not necessarily better than what
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_49_1' n='N049'/>came before it, but it represents the end of that particu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_50_1' n='N050'/>lar struggle.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_51_1' n='N051'/>At the end of a work day, I usually leave the studio
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_52_1' n='N052'/>abruptly. I can’t seem to even clean my brushes. I some¬
				<lb facs='#facs_77_region_1675008528270_1379_tl_53' n='N053'/>times forget to turn off the lights. If l’ve left a painting

				<lb facs='#facs_78_region_1675008547637_1385_tl_1' n='N001'/>that by the next day I am often terribly disappointed by
				<lb facs='#facs_78_region_1675008547637_1385_tl_2' n='N002'/>what had seemed pure genius. I often return to find a
				<lb facs='#facs_78_region_1675008547637_1385_tl_3' n='N003'/>finished painting not at all finished, or a group of
				<lb facs='#facs_78_region_1675008547637_1385_tl_4' n='N004'/>paintings I liked the day before suddenly repulsive to
				<lb facs='#facs_78_region_1675008547637_1385_tl_5' n='N005'/>me, superficial, eclectic, simplistic.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_region_1675008547637_1385_tl_6' n='N006'/>l’ve learned that a quick look can be very damaging.

				<lb facs='#facs_78_region_1675008547637_1385_tl_9' n='N009'/>work. More often than not, 1 am simply cutting off
				<lb facs='#facs_78_region_1675008547637_1385_tl_10' n='N010'/>myself and several day’s work, denying the seriousness
				<lb facs='#facs_78_region_1675008547637_1385_tl_11' n='N011'/>of that work and those thoughts.

				<lb facs='#facs_78_region_1675008547637_1385_tl_13' n='N013'/>imagine. I often switch roles on myself without being
				<lb facs='#facs_78_region_1675008547637_1385_tl_14' n='N014'/>aware of it. 1 suddenly have become a person who
				<lb facs='#facs_78_region_1675008547637_1385_tl_15' n='N015'/>stepped into my studio from the street, who despises the
				<lb facs='#facs_78_region_1675008547637_1385_tl_16' n='N016'/>work because she knows nothing about it and couldn’t
