			<p> When she was a woman of forty, the photographer clambered up a high fence beside the
				race track, focusing her European press camera on the turn-of-the-century automobile
				speed trials on <placeName key="Staten Island (New York, N.Y.)" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/168516706/">Staten Island</placeName>. One friend who was with her raised his own camera to
				record the photographerâso we can see <persName key="Austen, Elizabeth Alice 1866-" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/212370198/">Elizabeth Alice Austen</persName> up there still,
				athletically balanced on her precarious perch, concentrating single-mindedly on the
				picture she is taking, oblivious to her observer and to the other spectators around
				her and not giving a tinker's damn that her ankles are exposed below her long skirt
				in a most unladylike manner. The lover who was to share Aliceâs life and her
				enthusiasms for over fifty years, Gertrude <persName>Amelia Tate</persName>, is smiling quizzically at
				the second photographer: she and he may be sharing amusement at how very
				characteristic this unconventional pose is for Alice.</p>
			<p>From the time when she was very young, much about Alice Austenâs lifestyle and
				personality was unusual, according to the social conventions of her time and place.
				Just before or very soon after her birth in March, 1866, her father, an Englishman
				named Edward Munn, deserted her mother and vanished home to London, never to be
				heard from again. The abandoned Mrs. Munn, with her small baby and no means of
				support, returned to her parents' Victorian cottage on the east shore of Staten
				Island. She stopped using her married surname, and her bitterness toward her former
				husband communicated itself to her daughter. Small playmates in the neighborhood
				soon discovered that one sure way to enrage the little girl known as Alice Austen
				was to call her "Alice Munn.</p>
			<p>Aliceâs strong personality was formed in the 1860âs and 1870âs in her grandparentsâ
				home, where she was the only child in a household also shared by her mother, her
				Aunt Minnie and Minnieâs husband, and her young Uncle Peter, as well as by two or
				three resident Irish maids. She was the center of attention for all these adults,
				who played games with her, humored her fits of temper, encouraged her natural
				abilities at sports and mechanical skills, and helped to mold the unusual young
				woman Alice became.</p>
			<p>It was Aunt Minnieâs husband, a Danish-born sea captain, who changed the very nature
				of Aliceâs life by bringing home a camera in 1876. As he experimented with the bulky
				wooden box and demonstrated it to the family in the garden, Alice watched,
				enchanted. Although she was only ten years old, she was patient and intelligent, and
				strong enough to hold the camera steadily on its tripod; her hands were naturally
				skillful at adjusting the simple mechanism. When the Captain sailed away again, he
				gave her permission to play with it in his absence. Uncle Peter may have realized
				that in Aliceâs hands the camera was something more than a toy. During his frequent
				visits home, he showed his enthusiastic niece how to use chemicals to develop the
				negative images on the glass plates she exposed, and how to make prints from them.
				He and the Captain were probably the people who helped her further by installing, in
				an upstairs storage closet, a tiny home-built darkroom (which can still be seen
				today, with its deep shelves and remnants of Victorian linoleum, in the city-owned
				house on Staten Island).</p>
			<p>Young Alice spent hours on end in the darkroom, developing plates and toning and
				fixing her prints. Because there was no running water in the house when she was
				young, she carried the plates and prints down to the pump in the garden, to rinse
				them in basins of icy cold water, winter and summer, sometimes changing the rinse
				water as many as twenty-five times. By the time she was eighteen years old (the
				earliest year from which any of her photographs survive), Alice Austen was an
				experienced photographer with professional standards. It is worth emphasizing how
				early this was in photo- graphic history. Alfred Stieglitz (1864-1946) had only just
				exposed his first negative by the time Aliceâs skill was perfected. Alice began to
				take photographs some twenty years before Edward Steichen (1879-1973) bought his
				first camera in Milwaukee and twenty years before Eugene Atget (1857-1927) began to
				record the streets and people of Paris.</p>
			<p>The photographer whose work most closely resembles Alice Austenâs, Frances Benjamin
				Johnston, began working as a photojournalist in Washington, D.C., in the 1890âs,
				when she and Alice were both in their thir- ties. These two women probably never
				met, and may not even have heard of each other, but the similarities between them
				are striking. Johnston never married, and it is quite likely that she too was a
				lesbian, although âher private life remains hidden behind a veil of Victorian
				manners, as one biographer has written. Like Austen, she was well-connected socially
				and much-traveled, unconventional in many ways according to the norms of her
				society, a strong and independent woman whose career also lasted into the 1930âs.
				Johnston became known for her portraits of the famous (Susan B. Anthony, Alice
				Roosevelt, actresses, and the wives of the Presidential Cabinet) and of the obscure
				(women workers, Blacks, Indians), and above all for the realism of her documentary
				photographs (world expositions, Yellowstone Park, coal mines and battleships).</p>
			<p>Austen, like Johnston, was a realistic documentary <pb n="29"/>
				<pb n="30"/>
				<pb n="31"/> photographerâsomething unusual around the turn of the century, when the
				women photographers who were her contemporaries made pictures to illustrate
				Tennysonâs poems (Julia Margaret Cameron of England), portrayed pretty landscapes,
				dressed children as cherubs, posed themselves as nude dryads communing with nature
				(Annie Brigman of California), or, like Gertrude KÃ¤sebier of New York, tried to
				capture the Eternal Feminine Essence in sentimentalized studio portraits of mothers
				with their children. These other photographers typically used a soft, blurred focus
				and emphasized light and shadow in imitation of Impressionist painters, trying to
				prove that photographs were a form of Art by disguising the fact that they were made
				by mechanical meansâthe precise fact that Alice Austen enjoyed about her camera.</p>
			<p>Austen lived in the real world and photographed people and places as they actually
				appeared. She focused her lens so sharply that every small detail of leaf or
				woodwork, facial expression or lettering on a sign, was recorded. She began with the
				subjects closest to her âher grandmotherâs bedroom filled with Oriental vases and
				Victorian bric-a-brac, the household maids, and her girl friends in the garden
				posing with their tennis rac quets, banjos or swimming costumes.</p>
			<p>Instead of romantic idylls of motherhood, Alice photographed the Austens'
				harried-looking household worker, Mrs. Cocroft, with her ten small daughters.
				Perhaps she let the Cocroft children arrange themselves in the branches of her
				sumac, because she understood that little girls seldom had a legitimate excuse for
				climbing a tree. Certainly she never subjected children to the awful ordeal of
				posing in disguise as little angels. She appreciated them as they wereâinquisitive
				and busy, mischievous and often hard-working (as when selling newspapers on the
				streets of Manhattan).</p>
			<p>The women she recorded are as real and vigorous as Alice herself. Other photographers
				in the 1880âs and 1890âs chose to portray nymph-like young women float- ing in
				unruffled ponds or dancing effortlessly on tiptoe through flower-filled fields.
				Austen recorded her own friends in heavy bathing suits that were calculated to
				impede the movements of all but the strongest swimmers, and she showed them doing
				gymnastic exercises to develop the strength their daily activities required.</p>
			<p>The fact that Alice was a woman, often photograph- ing women, adds a special
				dimension to her work. No masculine camera could or would have invaded the private
				sanctum of the young Victorian lady, preserving for us the bedrooms of Trude
				Eccleston, Julia Marsh, Bessie Strong and of Alice herself, showing us all their
				souvenirs and home-made decorations. Only a woman's camera would record the
				unself-conscious affection of young women for one another, and their mockery of the
				conventional strictures of their society. Mrs. Snively and Miss Sanford would never
				have kicked up their skirts to reveal knees and ankles if a man had been watching,
				nor would Alice and her close friends have posed as cigarette-smoking depraved women
				orâworse stillâas dashing young men about town. Alice Austen did not waste any time
				pondering the essence of femininity.</p>
			<p>The fact that she was a woman also means that it was a considerable achievement to
				have produced a body of work as large (perhaps 8,000 negatives made over more than
				fifty years) and as excellent as hers. Austen did not have to worry about money when
				she was young, but she had to surmount the less tangible deterrent of Victorian
				social custom. The barriers to be overcome by the serious woman photographer (much
				more formidable a century ago than today) are described in The Womanâs Eye by Anne
				Tucker: âNot only must she find the time and energy to create, and establish her
				right to do so, but she must know what she wants to express and how best to express
				it. To achieve this, any artist has to explore and take risks, but so often a woman
				is handicapped by her public image as a woman.... Exploraation, whether of jungles
				or minds, is considered unfeminine and dangerous.... Beyond the realm of fashion,
				women are not encouraged to be original, but to look for approval." Austen received
				all the approval she needed from her family, from Gertrude Tate, and from her close
				friends. Victorian society was not strong enough to restrict her growth or to
				undermine her courage. She did exactly what she wanted to do.</p>
			<p>Everywhere she went she took her photographie equipment with her, some fifty pounds
				of it: cameras of different sizes, a tripod, magnesium flash attachment, and glass
				plates as big as eight by ten inches. In a horse-drawn buggy, she carried her
				equipment around the unpaved roads of rural Staten Islandâto the first tennis club
				in the nation, to winter skating parties on the Islandâs frozen ponds and creeks, to
				musicales in the Wardsâ house, to masquerades and to bowling parties given in the
				private alley of her friend Julia Marsh's mansion. Because she very seldom went out
				of her way to look for special photographic subjects, her pictures reveal her own
				way of life and her personality. Popular and extraordinarily energetic, young Alice
				Austen passed busy winters and happy summers in a social life that was, in her own
				words, âlarky," full of carefree sprees and pranks.</p>
			<p>But she took her photographic projects very seriously, even though she was not
				dependent upon them for her income. Time and time again, she transported her
				equipment on the ferry to Manhattan to document, and finally to publish in a small
				portfolio the people she called the "Street Types of New York"âthe cityâs newly-
				landed immigrants, street sweepers, rag pickers and peddlers, the lrish postmen and
				policemen, the news-- girls so poor that they went barefoot on the city streets, and
				the Russian and Polish Jewish women who sold eggs, chickens and vegetables in the
				open-air markets of the Lower East Side. She documented the arrival of <pb n="32"/>
				these immigrants, from the 1890âs until about 1910, in an exhaustive series of
				photographs of the federal quarantine facilities on Staten Island and on the nearby
				Hoff- mann and Swinburn hospital islands. The earliest of these photos, undertaken
				as a semi-professional assignment for the U.S. Public Health Service, was exhibited
				in Buffalo at the Pan-American Exposition of 1901. Alice traveled to that exposition
				with her camera, as she had done to the Worldâs Columbian Exposition in Chicago in
				the summer of 1893. She once took her photographic equipment along on a nine-day
				cruise with four friends through the canals of New Jersey and Delaware. On more
				conventional summer travels to the mountain resorts of upstate New York or through
				New England, she photographed scenic views and historic monuments, andâeven when
				hampered by a long-skirted traveling dressâgave not a momentâs thought to the
				obvious risk of crawling along a half-rotten log into the middle of a rapid stream
				in pursuit of the perfect angle.</p>
			<p>On one such summer excursion in 1899, visiting a Catskill hotel known as âTwilight
				Rest, Alice met Gertrude Tate, who was recuperating there from a bad case of typhoid
				fever. Gertrude was twenty-eight, a kindergarten teacher and professional dancing
				instructor, who worked to support her younger sister and widowed mother in Brooklyn.
				Judging from the small personal photo album that commemorates that summer,
				Gertrudeâs spontaneous gaiety and warm humor enchanted Alice, who was then
				thirty-three. Aliceâs casual sophistication, her forceful and winning personality,
				and her comfortable lifestyle, opened Gertrudeâs eyes to a wider world than she had
				known before. Gertrude began regu- larly to visit the Austen house on Staten Island,
				then to spend long summer holidays in Europe with Alice. But not until 1917, when
				her younger sister and mother gave up their Brooklyn house, did Gertrude, overriding
				her familyâs appalled objections over her âwrong devotion to Alice, finally move
				into the Austen house. She arrived just in time to keep Alice company there during
				her later years, for Aunt Minnie, at seventy-seven the last survivor of the family
				hosuehold, died the following year. Alice was then fifty-two, Gertrude in her
				mid-forties. They weathered the First World War with brisk fortitudeâAlice driving
				an ambulance for the local military hospital, both of them entertaining officers
				from nearby Fort Wadsworth and organizing small parties in their waterfront garden
				to wave Red Cross flags at the returning troop ships after Armistice.</p>
			<p>Disaster struck in 1929, when Alice lost all her capital in the stock market crash.
				She was sixty-three. She stopped taking photographs in the 1930âs, for film was too
				expensive a luxury in years when she was hard pressed to pay bills for electricity,
				fuel oil or a telephone. She mortgaged her house, then lost it when she failed to
				meet mortgage payments to the bankâin spite of income raised by Gertrudeâs dancing
				classes, the piecemeal sale of the Austen family antiques, the taking in of
				boarders, and the small restaurant she and Gertrude ran in the house in the 1940âs.
				The house was sold to new owners, who were not patient with two old and occa-
				sionally autocratic ladies.</p>
			<p>In the early summer of 1945, aged seventy-nine and severely crippled by arthritis,
				Alice Austen was forcibly evicted from the home which her grandparents had bought
				more than a century before and in which she had lived for all but the first few
				months of her life. Her house was not the only loss, for her personal papers disappeared and some two thousand of her precious glass negatives were hauled away to
				Newark, New Jersey, by the junk dealer who bought the remaining contents of her
				house for a mere 5600. The surviving 3500 photographs were rescued by a
				quick-witted volunteer from the Staten Island Historical Society, who spotted them
				on the upper floor of the house before the dealer got there.</p>
			<p>Alice and Gertrude moved into a small apartment in the nearby town of St. George,
				where Gertrude adjusted cheerfully to her new surroundings, but Alice sat in the
				wheelchair to which she was increasingly confined, staring with unseeing eyes at the
				view of New York har- bor and mourning for her old home. She was ill as well as
				miserably unhappy. Gertrude, after giving Alice love and companionship for the more
				than thirty years they had lived together, was finally no longer able to give her
				the nursing care she needed. She went to live with her married sister in Queens, and
				Alice, her money entirely gone after a year in a succession of private nursing
				homes, was in June, 1950, admitted as a legal pauper into the hospital ward of the
				local poorhouse, the Staten Island Farm Colony. She was eighty-four.</p>
			<p>But the story has a happy ending. One year later, a young editor in Manhattan set out
				a search for unpublished 19th-century photographs of American women. He discovered
				the Austen collection of 3500 photographs in the basement of the Staten Island
				Historical Society, and then discovered, to his horror, Miss Austen herself in a
				ward of forty beds in the poorhouse. Oliver Jensen, known today as one of the
				founders of the American Heritage Publishing Company, not only published her
				photos in his own book (The Revolt of American Women), but sold publication rights
				to Life, Holiday and other national magazines, raising enough money to release the
				photographer from the poorhouse and to establish her in a comfortable private
				nursing home for the last few months of her life. She was interviewed on CBS
				television, entertained at a party for 300 guests (including many of the old friends
				who appeared in her early photos), and honored with an exhibition of her work in the
				Richmondtown Museum. "Isnât the whole idea like a fairy tale?" exulted Gertrude
				Tate, who visited Alice regularly and who helped to prepare the guest lists.</p>
			<p>Two months after the party, Alice suffered a slight stroke and developed pneumonia in
				one lung. She died quietly in her wheelchair, in the morning sun on the porch of the
				nursing home, in June 1952, aged eighty-six. "My heart is so full of sorrow at my
				deep sense of loss, Gertrude wrote to Oliver Jensen. âShe was a rare soul, and her
				going leaves me bereft indeed.... God was good to spare me these long years when she
				needed me so much, so 1 can only thank him for answering my prayer, that I might be
				with her to the end."</p>
