			<head><title>Growing Up A Painter</title></head>
			<byline><persName key="Dona Nelson" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q20937927">Dona Nelson</persName></byline>
			<p> Present-day abstract painting is almost totally ruled by painting conventions:
				grids, stripes, panels, fields of all-over activity, images suspended in the middle
				of the canvas, etc. Why paint abstractly at all if our paintings are bound by more
				rigid organizing conventions than the portrait, landscape and still life ever were?
				A mountain is a complicated form. As <persName key="Paul CÃ©zanne" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q35548">Cezanne</persName> illustrated, it can inspire paintings
				endlessly, but after one has seen a few squares, a painting composed of squares, no
				matter how interesting the surface, color and space, suffers from a kind of
				familiarity. The whole of the painting ceases to compel active looking, and some of
				the adventure that painting can achieve is inevitably lost.</p>

			<p>It seems to me that so-called womanâs imagery (symmetrical images, grids, etc.) has
				more to do with oppression than anything elseâkeeping us in our places. It has to
				do with not creating.</p>
			<p>Likewise, the complacent <placeName key="New York City" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60">New York</placeName> art world does not inspire creation either as it is
				primarily oriented toward "good" and "bad" which are usually relative to what weâve
				known about before, and even these designations tend to be based on shallow âlooks"
				(painterly, hard-edge, slightly figurative, non-figurative) rather than on any
				substantial thinking about painting.</p>
			<p>It is very difficult, even painful, to examine all aspects of your painting and try
				to be fully conscious of the origins of everything that is there, to try to create
				the whole thing and make a truly personal art, but only then does one fully realize
				how adventuresome the attempt to make paintings is.</p>
			<p>The inherent genius of paint and canvas is this: out of the simultaneity of thoughts,
				having no absolute form, constantly impinged upon by the emotions, a hard physical
				thing arises, different from all those thoughts.</p>
			<p>I think abstract painting as a whole has gotten too simple, too far from the way the
				mind works. There seems to be such an overwhelming need to organize, achieve a kind
				of finality. <persName key="Agnes Martin" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q275610">Agnes Martin</persName> said, âThis painting I like because you can get in there
				and rest. The thing that seems most important to me is to escape the organizing
				conventions that allow us to rest and robs our paintings of the life that is in
				us.</p>
			<p>Painters have attempted to expand abstract painting by introducing design (so-called
				pattern painting), mathematical illustration (e.g. Robert Mangold), and general
				wall decoration (Stellaâs recent reliefs). Painting has lasted so long because of
				the flexible, expressive nature of its possibilitiesâcolor, surface, mark,
				flat-emanating space. The shift in attention from these concerns to compositional
				concerns (e.g. Stellaâs reliefsâa shape here, a shape there, a decorated surface
				here, a decor ated surface there) leads away from the particular things painting can
				do, away from painting itself.</p>
			<p>Abstract painting, far from being at its end, has just begun, but at its beginning,
				it was already proclaimed as a kind of all time culminationâa reflection of the
				goal-oriented, history-oriented, death-oriented, twentieth century obsession with
				progression, as if all the supposed links between things were more noteworthy than
				the things.</p>
			<p>I understand "reductiveâ (please excuse the word) paint- ing to be painting that
				attempts a very specific, resonant single space. The reductive impulse that has been
				important in abstract painting for the last twenty years has made for some very
				fine painting: Newman, Stella's black paintings, Mardenâs and Agnes Martinâs etc.
				This is the painting that I have loved best and thought most about because it is
				here that I have found a sense of place. I have admired and sought the reality that
				a painting can possess. I donât like the term "abstract" as it implies something
				second-rate to all the vivid realities of this world. The esthetic of grids and
				monochromatic planes is a highly artificial one. People who are not knowledgeable
				about modern painting will often make fun of, for instance, a single monochromatic
				panel, saying, "Is this what all the fuss is about? Itâs like the story of the
				emperor with no clothes. Artists hate this old saw, and yet it is said so often that
				I have begun to think about it. Human life and human beings are very complicated. It
				would seem natural that art might be more interesting and more relevant to more
				people if it in some way reflected this complexity. Although Cezanne is often talked
				about in relation to modern painting, particularly in relation to Marden, the thing
				that strikes me most when I look at Cezanne is his incredible complexity. In terms
				of space alone, he often allowed many different kinds of space within the same
				painting, many subtle shifts. Cezanneâs paintings are both deliberate and tentative,
				fixed and fluid, reflecting a whole mind rather than a single thought, a mind that
				could entertain grand themes, contradictions, and incomplete musings.</p>
			<p>Recently, I have been looking a lot at Pollock and DeKooning. I like the way Pollock
				was able to be very detailed and very big at the same timeâeverything happens at the
				same moment, in the present, on the surface. DeKooningâs life-long attitudes toward
				artmaking seem to me to be exceptionally healthy. He wrote, âArt should not have
				to be a certain way. He also said that the notion of having to will one thing "made
				him sick."</p>
			<p>In my own work, everything is entwined with some- thing elseâthe near altered by my
				memory of the far, a dark day, a Manet gray.</p>
			<p>New art comes about through an individual imagination simultaneously working upon
				past painting and the <pb n="81"/> specifics of a work in progress. So long as a
				person has seen other paintings, what she does will in some way be affected by what
				she has seen. If the effect is a rejection of male painting, than it has made its
				mark upon our paintings as surely as any other way. Mainly, I want to be conscious
				of how I have been affected. I do not mind learning from past painting so long as 1
				am fully conscious of the nature of that knowledge.</p>
			<p>Great painters, Manet and Cezanne consistently, others sporadically, are
				distinguished by a particular kind of inventive abilityâthe actual paint has yielded
				to their imaginations, thoughts, feelings. They have created new kinds of space.
				Painting space is not cartoon flatness or depth perspective, rather it is the
				thoroughly ambiguous space of a dream, the emotionally and physically inextricable,
				a flatness equivalent to unfamiliarspaces. In this realization, all great painting
				is abstract and expressive in the best and most subtle sense of the words.</p>
			<p>A paintingâs reality cannot be experienced through descriptions or photographs, and
				an artist who enjoys high visibility often suffers a kind of backwards invisibility. The art is shown, bought, talked about, written about and seems to become a
				known factor, with either a good reputation or a bad one, which doesnât need to be
				looked at anymore (an illusion).</p>
			<p>Looking at a painting is not like watching television; it is active rather than
				passive, a kind of claiming, satisfying just by itself. Anyone can "seeâ; but no
				one can see, casual viewer or museum curator, who will not let go of ego, judgments
				and categories long enough to penetrate a painting and allow it to penetrate
				them.</p>
			<p>Since painting is limited to an irreproducible thing, it has never been and will
				never be an art form to be enjoyed by huge numbers of people. In terms of their
				commercial allocations, paintings are luxury items, but such a designation doesnât
				say anything about their living nature as art. It just refers to the money swirl
				that goes on about them.</p>
			<p>Painting, like nature, and unlike politics and religion, is not moralistic. In
				painting as in music, poetry and dance, an individual has the opportunity of getting
				out from under the economic, sociological, psychological and political descriptions
				that are constantly foisted upon her from childhood by parents, education, peers,
				and society in general. In art, the real complexity and specificity of an
				experienced life can shine through. Far from being a luxury item, either making art
				or experiencing art should be the prerogative of every person on this earth.</p>
			<p>When I was still in schoolâabout ten years agoâsomeone said to me, in tones of awe
				and admiration, âDo you know that Stella knows what his painting is going to be like
				for the next ten years?â I didnât know if this was true, but 1 do know that even at
				that time 1 got a very uneasy feeling. Authority, control, clarity may be useful
				attributes for a businessman, but it seems to me that they are, more often than not,
				destructive and limiting to an artist. Anyone that knows me knows that I am as
				authoritative and verbal as any man, but recently I feel weary of myself like I long
				ago felt weary of most men. My painting is dark to me. I donât know âwhere itâs
				going." I hope it takes me someplace where I have never been before.</p>
