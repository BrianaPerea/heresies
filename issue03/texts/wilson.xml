         <head><title>Architectural Icon Ine Shrine 1 ne Votive The Gesture</title></head>
         <byline>Ann Wilson</byline>

         <epigraph>
            <p> “The Icon, then, is not only an aesthetical entity. It is the result of the faith
               and of the prayer. It is the life. The saving truth is not communicated by the word
               alone, but by the fact of awakening vital forces of life through the presentation of
               beauty. The icon carries with it the love of this beauty, and the beauty of this
               love." (Byzantine Bible)</p>
         </epigraph>
         <p>The idea is simple. Gesture gives grace, space gives grace, image gives grace, sound
            gives grace. Icons give grace. Vital energy, electric impulse, passes through grace to
            the beholder. Behold, to be held. This vital energy is present in echoes, ancient
            shrines, whose purpose is now missing, whisper. Walls built to enact transformations
            which poets feel when they are impelled—what music casts over the mind. Spirits that
            exalt and glorify, spirits usually rare and capricious should be permanently fixed,
            working miracles perpetually for every one. Spatial humanism - humanity at
            magnitude—value in light and shadow—true perspective. That art whose attempt is
            delineation of the divine mirror. That subtlety which is more fine because it abjures
            extravagance or fantasy. Our need for votive architecture never died. Time changes the
            abstract order moti- vated by our need for intellectual security with which to summon
            inspiration. Inspiration sustains the purpose of living. The demands of each epoch’s
            external pressures on the biological frames encasing our spirits press from us an
            architecture of expedience like wine from grapes “Every epoch is a sphinx which plunges
            into the abyss as soon as its problem is solved." Roman walled gardens yielded a further
            retreat within Romanesque cloisters. Roses bloom in secret spaces. Votive—fragment—a
            fragment of gesture—stones of a wall running through an empty plain to the rock
            mountain. Ridge—snow—votive—gesture. The gesture of respect. A marble seat for the
            priestess set in the center of the front circle of the ampitheater. Stone fall—blue sky-
            empty space. A bench encircled the outer walls of a building and clay votive objects lay
            on it Hieroglyphs of information—puzzle pieces—spaces out of the architecture of
            gestures. Stones laid for liturgy—before the column came the gesture of the column. On
            the trail of imprints, of gestures left long ago in air. A sound, the corner of the
            stairway, the lock on a gate, flowers in the ruins. The way the foot fits in a stone
            path which loses outline in vanished direction. Cows within temple precincts, wandered
            from India. A roof given way to sky illuminates mosaic squares, formal elements—natural
            elements—the elements. When you look at the sphere of our sun is it conceived
            differently if you stand in the exact center of a square? If you separate candles into a
            red glass, a blue glass, and a yellow glass, does your perception give the retina a
            different neural message for each color? Are we always composing processional spaces to
            approach our intuition? When you walk between columns toward the center do you begin to
            feel the effect of your progress toward the conclusion? Is geometry perhaps the
            repository of ancient sacrificial gesture? The Chinese, who have had a long time to
            think, have over a hundred names for differing shades of blue. Where do colors come
            from? Who am 1? Where do I come from? Where am I going? Liturgies are a logical order
            for progressions toward their fullest possible human form—mundra. This is an invocation.
            A statement of presence within defined votive space. A rejoicing. A statement of belief.
            A blessing and a recessional. The perfect logic of respect. Biotechnology. The body as
            media, simplifying and clarifying ways to receive natural energies. Images which travel
            from era to era and are electric. Human needs are warmed by that same ancient fire. The
            walls we create are the containers and guardians of our continued relation to the light
            source. Electric affinities. “Each mortal thing does one thing and the same: deals out
            that being indoors each one dwells. </p>
