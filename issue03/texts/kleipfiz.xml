         <head><title>theyre always curious</title></head>

         <p> they’re always curious about what you eat as if you were some strange breed still
            unclassified by darwin &amp; whether you cook every night &amp; wouldn’t it be easier
            for you to buy frozen dinners but i am quick to point out that my intravenous tubing has
            been taken out and they back up saying i could never just cook for one person but i tell
            them it's the same exactly the same as for two except half</p>
         <p>but more they’re curious about what you do when the urge is on &amp; if you use a coke
            bottle or some psychedelic dildo or electric vibrator or just the good old finger or
            whole hand &amp; do you mannippppulllaaatttte yourself into a clit orgasm or just kind
            of keep digging away at yourself &amp; if you mind it &amp; when you have affairs
            doesn’t it hurt when it's over &amp; it certainly must be lonely to go back to the old
            finger</p>
         <p>&amp; they always cluck over the amount of space you require &amp; certainly the extra
            bedroom seems unnecessary &amp; i try to explain that i like to move around &amp; that i
            get antsy when i have the urge so that it’s nice to have an extra place to go when
            you’re lonely &amp; after all it seems small compensation for using the good old finger
            &amp; they’re surprised because they never thought of it that way &amp; it does seem
            reasonable come to think of it</p>
         <p>&amp; they kind of probe about your future &amp; if you have a will or why you bother to
            accumulate all that stuff or what you plan to do with your old age &amp; aren’t you
            scared about being put away somewhere or found on your bathroom floor dead after your
            downstairs neighbor has smelled you out but then of course you don’t have the worry of
            who goes first though of course you know couples live longer for they have something to
            live for &amp; i try to explain i live for myself even when in love but it’s a hard
            concept to explain when you feel lonely</p>
