				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_1_1' n='N001'/>The original version of this paper was intended for, and

				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_4' n='N004'/>Convention. The paper was entitled, “The Purification

				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_6' n='N006'/>have written other versions on this subject of the lesbian

				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_8' n='N008'/>can only finally complete what I have to say in book-
				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_9' n='N009'/>length form. So l’ve started writing the book. The ver¬

				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_11' n='N011'/>examples here, however, l have chosen mostly instances
				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_12' n='N012'/>of popular literature—such as Dracula, Jaws, Burnt
				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_13' n='N013'/>Offerings, etc. Expanded, this essay on the idea of lesbian
				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_14' n='N014'/>monstrosity in popular fiction will form one chapter of

				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_1_2' n='N001'/>of the inedible by the unspeakable. It is also the pursuit
				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_2_2' n='N002'/>of the unspeakable by the inedible; and it is this particu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_3_2' n='N003'/>larly. As lesbians are &quot;unspeakable” so is &quot;lesbianism&quot; a
				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_4_1' n='N004'/>taste for the &quot;inedible.&quot; Literature (in any form) is like
				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_5_1' n='N005'/>the fox, a luxury; a peripheral pastime, because it is
				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_6_1' n='N006'/>inedible; and so is lesbianism. Lesbians and lesbian liter¬
				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_7_1' n='N007'/>ature are unspeakable and inedible. Most contemporary
				<lb facs='#facs_8_region_1674859253742_417_tl_8_1' n='N008'/>attempts to make both palatable and &quot;speakable” (to put

				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_1' n='N001'/>blood prefer to do that instead. Most lesbians (like
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_2' n='N002'/>everyone else) would rather feel than read; they thus
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_3' n='N003'/>achieve their most longed-for goal: to be like everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_4' n='N004'/>else. And that is too bad. Lesbians, instead, might have
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_5' n='N005'/>been great, as some literature is: unassimilable, awe¬

				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_9' n='N009'/>have always been, invented to express what ordinary
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_10' n='N010'/>people cannot: feeling. Monsters (among other things)
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_11' n='N011'/>are emblems of feeling in patriarchy. The enemy of the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_12' n='N012'/>monster is phallic materialism, which demands that
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_13' n='N013'/>chaos be shaped and ordered, made sexually econom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_14' n='N014'/>ical, around the emblem of a cock. The literature of
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_15' n='N015'/>phallic materialism is about reducing “chaos” (wilder¬
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_16' n='N016'/>ness, woman, imagination, the erotic) into an erect (pre¬

				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_19' n='N019'/>genital spasm). The story is about what it means to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_20' n='N020'/>cock; and what it means to be the other end of the cock.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_21' n='N021'/>The most inventive of these stories is regularly awarded
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_22' n='N022'/>the Nobel Prize. &quot;Invention” in these stories regularly
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_23' n='N023'/>takes the form of what constitutes the other end of the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_24' n='N024'/>cock: what form the monster will take.

				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_27' n='N027'/>do not understand that a lesbian form significantly dif¬

				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_29' n='N029'/>achieved through sexual substitution. For example, two

				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_31' n='N031'/>parental opposition, surviving the wilderness, enjoying

				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_39' n='N039'/>all the others, are not good&quot; books. They are—and so
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_40' n='N040'/>are the excruciatingly refined recollections of a dear old

				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_42' n='N042'/>for the call of the Wild. Anything is, after all, better
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_43' n='N043'/>than nothing. My complaint lies in the fact that these
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_44' n='N044'/>individual turnabouts of heterosexual reality seem, to
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_45' n='N045'/>many, to constitute a literary expression of lesbian sensi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_46' n='N046'/>bility; and as such distract us from the apprehension of
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_47' n='N047'/>lesbian reality.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_48' n='N048'/>The great service of literature is to show us who we
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_49' n='N049'/>are. Put more simply, we tend to behave, and think, as
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_50' n='N050'/>books show us how to behave and think (and I am being
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_51' n='N051'/>deliberately naive here—I do know that movies and tele¬

				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_53' n='N053'/>books as behavior show-ers and shapers). Lesbians, his¬

				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_55' n='N055'/>have especially relied on imaginative literature to dream
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_56' n='N056'/>themselves into situations of cultural, political and
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_57' n='N057'/>moral power. Twenty years ago, without Molly Bolt,
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_58' n='N058'/>we were Rhett Butler and Stephen Gordon and the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_59' n='N059'/>Count of Monte Cristo. It is, of course, much more to
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_60' n='N060'/>the point to be Molly Bolt—or Patience or Sarah or
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_61' n='N061'/>Mrs. Stevens. The trouble with this process (vulgarly

				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_14_1' n='N014'/>literature—of the existence of lesbians. As though we
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_15_1' n='N015'/>were spending all our lives in the courts of law, we rely
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_16_1' n='N016'/>almost entirely on materiality as evidence of truth. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_17_1' n='N017'/>sexual materiality, of course, that is these days the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_18_1' n='N018'/>supreme evidence, not only of truth and love but,
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_19_1' n='N019'/>indeed, that one is alive. And perhaps it has always been
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_20_1' n='N020'/>so; and perhaps it is best that it is so. But lesbians have
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_21_1' n='N021'/>been unable to enact a completely lesbian reality—and
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_22_1' n='N022'/>therefore, a literature—because of such reliance on the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_region_1674859274408_426_tl_23_1' n='N023'/>sensational as proof of existence: because we have been

				<lb facs='#facs_10_region_1674859298985_435_tl_4' n='N004'/>&quot;chance,&quot; can be; and this is a wish for salvation—and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_region_1674859298985_435_tl_5' n='N005'/>salvaging. Such a wish, expressed in an entirely whole
				<lb facs='#facs_10_region_1674859298985_435_tl_6' n='N006'/>social context, makes a literature in which heroes appear

				<lb facs='#facs_10_region_1674859298985_435_tl_8' n='N008'/>intellectuality, suffering. Each task accomplished for the

				<lb facs='#facs_10_region_1674859298985_435_tl_10' n='N010'/>the culture whose need he has accomplished. The task
				<lb facs='#facs_10_region_1674859298985_435_tl_11' n='N011'/>itself changes from time to time; from place to place;
				<lb facs='#facs_10_region_1674859298985_435_tl_12' n='N012'/>but its purpose—transcendence—does not. The lesbian
