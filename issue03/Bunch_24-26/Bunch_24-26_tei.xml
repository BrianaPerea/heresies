				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_1' n='N001'/>First, I believe that the existence + visibility of feminist (and esp.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_2' n='N002'/>lesbian-feminist) writing that we have today is largely a result of
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_3' n='N003'/>the existence of feminist presses, periodicals, journals, and books
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_4' n='N004'/>over the past 10 years.

				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_6' n='N006'/>not created and demonstrated the market.)
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_7' n='N007'/>This is so not only because feminists print much of our own writing and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_8' n='N008'/>created the market -- But also -- even more -- because the existence
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_9' n='N009'/>of feminist media has inspired and created new writing:
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_10' n='N010'/>-new ways of thinking and working
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_11' n='N011'/>-new topics for exploration in both fiction and non-fiction
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_12' n='N012'/>When I say that feminist presses have created atmosphere t possibilities
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_13' n='N013'/>that inspire more and more new work-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_14' n='N014'/>I don&apos;t just mean most recent, most &quot;developed&quot; presses...

				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_16' n='N016'/>I mean that this is a process with a History: feminist publications

				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_18' n='N018'/>Feminist media has always been closely tied to the beginnings of women&apos;s movt.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_19' n='N019'/>since the days of the mimeograph machine, when our struggle to define
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_20' n='N020'/>ourselves and control our lives was cranking out 500 copies of

				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_22' n='N022'/>(We believed with a religious fervor that if only we could get more copies
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_23' n='N023'/>out to more women so they knew what we knew -- then things would change.)
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_24' n='N024'/>Those were times not only of religious fervor but also exotic energy-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_25' n='N025'/>even when I was &quot;straight&quot; in the women&apos;s liberation days of 1968-69,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_26' n='N026'/>some of our most erotic times were spent around the mimeo machine...
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_27' n='N027'/>Before we could admit to sexuality between women, it was there in our work together.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_28' n='N028'/>-feminist presses have always been integral to spreading our movt.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_29' n='N029'/>We quickly saw that we needed more than occasional mimeoed tracts
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_30' n='N030'/>(although these still play a real role),
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_31' n='N031'/>We saw the boys - right and left - chopping up our articles and interviews
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_32' n='N032'/>in their presses - if they ran them at all.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_33' n='N033'/>So about 1970--they began: Off Our Backs: It Aint Me Babe; Women: A Journal
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_34' n='N034'/>of Liberation; Aint I A Woman, etc.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_35' n='N035'/>Now there are over 200 feminist newspapers, magazines, presses and publishers
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_36' n='N036'/>and another 30-440 women&apos;s booksotres.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_region_1674937417874_675_tl_37' n='N037'/>All of that material from mimeo to finely published books is the feminist press.
