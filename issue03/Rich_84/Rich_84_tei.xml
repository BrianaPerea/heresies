					<l>The autumn feels slowed-down,</l>
					<l>summer still holds on here, even the light</l>
					<l>seems to last longer than it should</l>
					<l>or maybe l’m using it to the thin edge.</l>
					<l>The moon rolls in the air. I didn’t want this child.</l>
					<l>You’re the only one l’ve told.</l>
					<l>I want a child maybe, someday, but not now.</l>
					<l>Otto has a calm, complacent way</l>
					<l>of following me with his eyes, as if to say</l>
					<l>Soon you&apos;ll have your hands full!</l>
					<l>And yes, I will; this child will be mine,</l>
					<l>not his, the failures, if I fail</l>
					<l>will be all mine. We’re not good, Clara,</l>
					<l>at learning to prevent these things,</l>
					<l>and once we have a child, it is ours.</l>
					<l>But lately, I feel beyond Otto or anyone.</l>
					<l>Iknow now the kind of work I have to do.</l>
					<l>It takes such energy! I have the feeling l’m</l>
					<l>moving somewhere, patiently, impatiently,</l>
					<l>in my loneliness. l’m looking everywhere in nature</l>
					<l>for new forms, old forms in new places,</l>
					<l>the planes of an antique mouth, let’s say, among the leaves.</l>
					<l>Iknow and do not know</l>
					<l>what 1 am searching for.</l>
					<l>Remember those months in the studio together,</l>
					<l>you up to your strong forearms in wet clay,</l>
					<l>I trying to make something of the strange impressions</l>
					<l>assailing me—the Japanese</l>
					<l>flowers and birds on silk, the drunks</l>
					<l>sheltering in the Louvre, the river-light,</l>
					<l>those faces...Did we know exactly</l>
					<l>why we were there? Paris unnerved you,</l>
					<l>you found it too much, yet you went on</l>
					<l>with your work... and later we met there again,</l>
					<l>both married then, and I thought you and Rilke</l>
					<l>both seemed unnerved. I felt a kind of joylessness</l>
					<l>between you. Of course he and I</l>
					<l>have had our difficulties. Maybe I was jealous</l>
					<l>of him, to begin with, taking you from me,</l>
					<l>maybe I married Otto to fill up</l>
					<l>my loneliness for you.</l>
					<l>Rainer, of course, knows more than Otto knows,</l>
					<l>he believes in women. But he feeds on us,</l>
					<l>like all of them. His whole life, his art</l>
					<l>is protected by women. Which of us could say that?</l>
					<l>Which of us, Clara, hasn’t had to take that leap</l>
					<l>out beyond our being women</l>
					<l>to save our work?</l>
					<l>or is it to save ourselves?</l>

					<l>Paula Becker to Clara Westhoff</l>

			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Paula Becker 1876-1907</l>
					<l>Clara Westhoff 1878-1954</l>
					<l>became friends at Worpswede, an artists’ colony near Bremen, Germany, summer</l>
					<l>1899. In January 1900, they spent a half-year together in Paris, where Paula painted</l>
					<l>and Clara studied sculpture with Rodin. In August they returned to Worpswede,</l>
					<l>and spent the next winter together in Berlin. In 1901, Clara married the poet Rainer</l>
					<l>Maria Rilke; soon after, Paula married the painter Otto Modersohn. She died in a</l>
					<l>hemorrhage after childbirth, murmuring, What a pity!</l>

					<l>Marriage is lonelier than solitude.</l>
					<l>Do you know: I was dreaming I had died</l>
					<l>giving birth to the child.</l>
					<l>I couldn’t paint or speak or even move.</l>
					<l>My child—I think—survived me. But what was funny</l>
					<l>in the dream was, Rainer had written my requiem¬</l>
					<l>a long, beautiful poem, and calling me his friend.</l>
					<l>I was your friend</l>
					<l>but in the dream you didn’t say a word.</l>
					<l>In the dream his poem was like a letter.</l>
					<l>to someone who has no right</l>
					<l>to be there but must be treated gently, like a guest</l>
					<l>who comes on the wrong day. Clara, why don’t I dream of you</l>
					<l>That photo of the two of us—I have it still,</l>
					<l>you and I looking hard into each other</l>
					<l>and my painting behind us. How we used to work</l>
					<l>side by side! And how l’ve worked since then</l>
					<l>trying to create according to our plar</l>
					<l>that we’d bring, against all odds, our full power</l>
					<l>to every subject. Hold back nothing</l>
					<l>because we were women. Clara, our strength still lies</l>
					<l>in the things we used to talk about:</l>
					<l>how life and death take one another’s hands,</l>
					<l>the struggle for truth, our old pledge against guilt.</l>
					<l>And now I feel dawn and the coming day.</l>
					<l>Ilove waking in my studio, seeing my pictures</l>
					<l>come alive in the light. Sometimes I feel</l>
					<l>it is myself that kicks inside me,</l>
					<l>myself I must give suck to, love..</l>
					<l>I wish we could have done this for each other</l>
					<l>all our lives, but we can’t...</l>
					<l>They say a pregnant woman</l>
					<l>dreams of her own death. But life and death</l>
					<l>take one another’s hands. Clara, I feel so full</l>
					<l>of work, the life I see ahead, and love</l>
					<l>for you, who of all people</l>
					<l>however badly I say this</l>
					<l>will hear all I say and cannot say.</l>

					<l>Several phrases in this poem are drawn from actual diaries and</l>
					<l>letters of Paula Modersohn-Becker, as translated from the</l>
					<l>German by Liselotte Erlanger. (No published edition in English</l>
					<l>of these extraordinary writings yet exists.) Rilke did, in fact,</l>
					<l>write a Requiem for Modersohn-Becker. Perhaps this poem is</l>
					<l>my answer to his.</l>
					<l>This poem will be included in a forthcoming book to be enti¬</l>
					<l>tled The Dream of a Common Language.</l>
