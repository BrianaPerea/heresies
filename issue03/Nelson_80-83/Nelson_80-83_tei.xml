				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_1' n='N001'/>Present-day abstract painting is almost totally ruled by
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_2' n='N002'/>painting conventions: grids, stripes, panels, fields of all¬
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_3' n='N003'/>over activity, images suspended in the middle of the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_4' n='N004'/>canvas, etc. Why paint abstractly at all if our paintings
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_5' n='N005'/>are bound by more rigid organizing conventions than
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_6' n='N006'/>the portrait, landscape and still life ever were? A
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_7' n='N007'/>mountain is a complicated form. As Cezanne illus¬
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_8' n='N008'/>trated, it can inspire paintings endlessly, but after one
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_9' n='N009'/>has seen a few squares, a painting composed of squares,
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_10' n='N010'/>no matter how interesting the surface, color and space,
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_11' n='N011'/>suffers from a kind of familiarity. The whole of the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_12' n='N012'/>painting ceases to compel active looking, and some of
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_13' n='N013'/>the adventure that painting can achieve is inevitably
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_14' n='N014'/>lost.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_15' n='N015'/>It seems to me that so-called woman’s imagery (sym¬
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_16' n='N016'/>metrical images, grids, etc.) has more to do with oppres¬
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_17' n='N017'/>sion than anything else—keeping us in our places. It has
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_18' n='N018'/>to do with not creating.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_19' n='N019'/>Likewise, the complacent New York art world does not
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_20' n='N020'/>inspire creation either as it is primarily oriented toward
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_21' n='N021'/>&quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; which are usually relative to what
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_22' n='N022'/>we’ve known about before, and even these designations
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_23' n='N023'/>tend to be based on shallow “looks&quot; (painterly, hard¬
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_24' n='N024'/>edge, slightly figurative, non-figurative) rather than on
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_25' n='N025'/>any substantial thinking about painting.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_26' n='N026'/>It is very difficult, even painful, to examine all aspects
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_27' n='N027'/>of your painting and try to be fully conscious of the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_28' n='N028'/>origins of everything that is there, to try to create the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_29' n='N029'/>whole thing and make a truly personal art, but only
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_30' n='N030'/>then does one fully realize how adventuresome the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_31' n='N031'/>attempt to make paintings is.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_32' n='N032'/>The inherent genius of paint and canvas is this: out of
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_33' n='N033'/>the simultaneity of thoughts, having no absolute form,
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_34' n='N034'/>constantly impinged upon by the emotions, a hard
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_35' n='N035'/>physical thing arises, different from all those thoughts.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_36' n='N036'/>I think abstract painting as a whole has gotten too
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_37' n='N037'/>simple, too far from the way the mind works. There
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_38' n='N038'/>seems to be such an overwhelming need to organize,
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_39' n='N039'/>achieve a kind of finality. Agnes Martin said, “This
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_40' n='N040'/>painting I like because you can get in there and rest.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_41' n='N041'/>The thing that seems most important to me is to escape
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_42' n='N042'/>the organizing conventions that allow us to rest and robs
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_43' n='N043'/>our paintings of the life that is in us.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_44' n='N044'/>Painters have attempted to expand abstract painting by
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_45' n='N045'/>introducing design (so-called pattern painting), math¬
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_46' n='N046'/>ematical illustration (e.g. Robert Mangold), and general
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_47' n='N047'/>wall decoration (Stella’s recent reliefs). Painting has
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_48' n='N048'/>lasted so long because of the flexible, expressive nature
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_49' n='N049'/>of its possibilities—color, surface, mark, flat-emanating
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_50' n='N050'/>space. The shift in attention from these concerns to
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_51' n='N051'/>compositional concerns (e.g. Stella’s reliefs—a shape
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_52' n='N052'/>here, a shape there, a decorated surface here, a decor
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_53' n='N053'/>ated surface there) leads away from the particular things

				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_3_1' n='N003'/>begun, but at its beginning, it was already proclaimed as
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_4_1' n='N004'/>a kind of all time culmination—a reflection of the goal¬

				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_11_1' n='N011'/>single space. The reductive impulse that has been im¬

				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_13_1' n='N013'/>made for some very fine painting: Newman, Stella&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_14_1' n='N014'/>black paintings, Marden’s and Agnes Martin’s etc. This
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_15_1' n='N015'/>is the painting that I have loved best and thought most
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_16_1' n='N016'/>about because it is here that I have found a sense of
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_17_1' n='N017'/>place. I have admired and sought the reality that a
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_18_1' n='N018'/>painting can possess. I don’t like the term &quot;abstract&quot; as it
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_19_1' n='N019'/>implies something second-rate to all the vivid realities of
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_20_1' n='N020'/>this world. The esthetic of grids and monochromatic
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_21_1' n='N021'/>planes is a highly artificial one. People who are not
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_22_1' n='N022'/>knowledgeable about modern painting will often make
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_23_1' n='N023'/>fun of, for instance, a single monochromatic panel,
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_24_1' n='N024'/>saying, &quot;Is this what all the fuss is about? It’s like the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_25_1' n='N025'/>story of the emperor with no clothes. Artists hate this
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_26_1' n='N026'/>old saw, and yet it is said so often that I have begun to
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_27_1' n='N027'/>think about it. Human life and human beings are very
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_28_1' n='N028'/>complicated. It would seem natural that art might be
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_29_1' n='N029'/>more interesting and more relevant to more people if
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_30_1' n='N030'/>it in some way reflected this complexity. Although
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_31_1' n='N031'/>Cezanne is often talked about in relation to modern
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_32_1' n='N032'/>painting, particularly in relation to Marden, the thing
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_33_1' n='N033'/>that strikes me most when I look at Cezanne is his in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_34_1' n='N034'/>credible complexity. In terms of space alone, he often
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_35_1' n='N035'/>allowed many different kinds of space within the same
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_36_1' n='N036'/>painting, many subtle shifts. Cezanne’s paintings are
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_37_1' n='N037'/>both deliberate and tentative, fixed and fluid, reflecting
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_38_1' n='N038'/>a whole mind rather than a single thought, a mind that
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_39_1' n='N039'/>could entertain grand themes, contradictions, and in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_40_1' n='N040'/>complete musings.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_41_1' n='N041'/>Recently, I have been looking a lot at Pollock and
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_42_1' n='N042'/>DeKooning. I like the way Pollock was able to be very
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_43_1' n='N043'/>detailed and very big at the same time—everything
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_44_1' n='N044'/>happens at the same moment, in the present, on the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_45_1' n='N045'/>surface. DeKooning’s life-long attitudes toward art¬
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_46_1' n='N046'/>making seem to me to be exceptionally healthy. He
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_47_1' n='N047'/>wrote, “Art should not have to be a certain way. He
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_48_1' n='N048'/>also said that the notion of having to will one thing
				<lb facs='#facs_83_region_1675009124238_1438_tl_49_1' n='N049'/>&quot;made him sick.

				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_1' n='N001'/>specifics of a work in progress. So long as a person has
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_2' n='N002'/>seen other paintings, what she does will in some way be
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_3' n='N003'/>affected by what she has seen. If the effect is a rejection
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_4' n='N004'/>of male painting, than it has made its mark upon our
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_5' n='N005'/>paintings as surely as any other way. Mainly, I want to
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_6' n='N006'/>be conscious of how I have been affected. I do not mind
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_7' n='N007'/>learning from past painting so long as 1 am fully
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_8' n='N008'/>conscious of the nature of that knowledge.

				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_10' n='N010'/>sporadically, are distinguished by a particular kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_11' n='N011'/>inventive ability—the actual paint has yielded to their
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_12' n='N012'/>imaginations, thoughts, feelings. They have created
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_13' n='N013'/>new kinds of space. Painting space is not cartoon
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_14' n='N014'/>flatness or depth perspective, rather it is the thoroughly
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_15' n='N015'/>ambiguous space of a dream, the emotionally and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_16' n='N016'/>physically inextricable, a flatness equivalent to un¬
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_17' n='N017'/>familiarspaces. In this realization, all great painting is
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_18' n='N018'/>abstract and expressive in the best and most subtle sense
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_19' n='N019'/>of the words.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_20' n='N020'/>A painting’s reality cannot be experienced through

				<lb facs='#facs_84_region_1675009141238_1447_tl_23' n='N023'/>ibility. The art is shown, bought, talked about, written
