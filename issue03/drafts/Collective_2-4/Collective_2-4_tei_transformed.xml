				From The Lesbian Issue
				Collective: </p>
         <p>
				l’m a writer who
				struggles constantly with the urge to re¬ main silent. And I understood our
				collective process as a struggle with silence. Like an
				individual isolated lesbian, we worked first on self-validation. We
				talked about the famous respected closet cases—could we get them
				to come out or figure some way to claim them. (Claiming the "great ones" is a way for a
				despised group to feel
				good about itself.) And we spent many many meetings doing
				consciousness-raising on what it means to be lesbian artists—talking,
				some of us, about issues we had never discussed before. My
				excitement in working on this issue of Heresies centered around
				the hope that many lesbian artists would write us, share their work, and contribute to this dialogue. The standard I used in
				judging work was based on my wish to be inclusive—to present as much diversity as possible, to present clearly
				articulated articles even if I disagreed with their content. Others in the collective
				felt differently. This we discovered as we worked and worked
				and no longer had time just to talk to each other. We had
				been too busy when we started—dis¬ cussing our similarities, our struggles, our fears, and our op¬ portunities as lesbian
				artists—to get very far in discussing our differences. Cynthia Carr </p>
         <p>
				The only talent I bring
				to the lesbian collective is my sexual preference, a scorn of
				self-important pretension, a nose for drivel, and a desire to
				see to it that we say it like it is. In the past we have done
				ourselves and our work a terrible damage by lying about our
				experience. Driven by a need for the com- fort of a common
				political position, we have all too often allowed rhetoric to
				pass for truth. Seeking an accommodation with the straight
				world, we have lied about our essential dif- ference. And in a
				spirit of loyalty we have compromised our¬ selves by supporting
				thinking and work which is simply bad. There is very little
				sense of humor in us. We have, by this excusable example,
				leaned heavily on many closet doors which might otherwise
				have sprung open. It was my hope that with this issue we
				might present truly good work by lesbians. Now, as I am about to
				be pasted up and mechanicaled, I can say that the effort
				has been exhausting and perilous. And cer¬ tainly I am too close
				to the final product to say that we have succeeded. Betsy Crowell </p>
         <p>
				I usually think of
				myself as part scientist and part magician with certain skills
				that sometimes make art. Neither feminism nor lesbianism
				determine the form and content of my work yet it was only with the
				security of the former and the coming to terms with the latter
				(the muse) that my life and art began to be uniquely and overtly
				me. Initially I worked
				on the issue seeking a community to explore in depth the
				relationship of lesbianism to the artist and to discover what would
				happen if lesbian art and artists were brought together. Our
				editorial collective’s discussions were some of the most
				provoking and intimate that I have experi¬ enced, yet after each
				I felt a sense of panic. I know that les¬ bians have made great
				art, I know that lesbians have been major contributors to
				culture, and I believe that lesbianism in the largest and most
				powerful sense of the word has been cen¬ tral not peripheral to
				the creative world of woman, yet I was worried that we
				wouldn’t receive sufficient "good” material. I also feared being
				viewed through society’s homophobic lenses </p>
         <p>
				yet I will not obscure
				the importance of lesbianism to my life and art. The muse and I
				are inextricably entwined and she is a woman. I struggle
				continually against any restrictions on my identity while
				questioning why this culture relentlessly omits and suppresses from
				discussion and history (even in the feminist community) the
				essentialness of lesbianism to the creative lives of women
					However, there was
				a far deeper reason for my panic. After nine months of working
				on this issue 1 felt that our greatest unfaced demon was our
				own homophobia absorbed by all of us in different ways
				from a culture so homophobic that it ruth¬ lessly suppresses and
				punished all exploration of female sexuality. This,
				coupled with the fact that lesbian artists des¬ perately need
				visibility and credibility, gave us a common unexamined goal:
				visibility as matured and serious artists. This is only a
				beginning. Omitted from the issue is any dialogue that examines
				the role of lesbianism as central to women claiming full
				power over their sexuality and that such power is the root of
				strong and unique art. Do not for a minute imagine that
				art has to be explicitly about sex or any¬ thing so simplistic. I
				am speaking rather to the fact that a person must be able to
				put the full force of herself behind her work. Fear of being
				seen as sexual, fear of the audience, fear of offending heterosexual
				friends, fear of retribution for creating or being in the issue
				are only a few of the fears that are real and need to be faced
				before we can initiate a discussion that begins from a point that
				assumes that lesbianism is the key to the powerfulness of all
				women. Betsy Damon </p>
         <p>
				I wanted an issue on
				lesbian art and artists that would pro¬ voke me; an issue that
				would challenge all the assumptions I have about lesbians and
				art; an issue that would leave me filled with questions and with the energy with which to explore the questions
				further. I wanted lesbians to be excited and disturbed by what
				they read here, finding glimpses of themselves, as well as
				a sense of what is missing. What stories are still untold? What are lesbians? What
				are artists? In trying to reach a working definition of
				these two most basic questions, a sense of my own alienation
				from the task before us began to grow. This alienation came
				from being forced to examine sexuality from within a
				patriarchal context. A context which has created distinctions
				and categories in order to maintain its own power and
				privilege. The advantages gained by society's "power-brokers" through perpetuating and emphasizing the differences among
				racial, economic, sexual, and religious groups are clear. The
				most apparent difference between myself and a heterosexual
				woman; or myself (white, middle-class), and a Chicano
				working-class woman—is one of privilege. And for me, as a
				lesbian, as white, as middle-class, to main¬ tain and perpetuate
				differences that ultimately exist only to deny privilege to
				some, seems wrong. One way I see myself as a lesbian perpetuating
				differences is in my focusing on what is and what is not a
				lesbian. "A woman who does not sleep with men." “Any woman
				who calls herself a lesbian.” “A woman that loves and sleeps
				with other women." “What if she sleeps with a man one time?
				Is she still a lesbian?” “What if she used to sleep with men,
				used to be married to one, and doesn’t now, but can’t predict the
				future?" “What is the difference between a woman-identified-woman
				and a lesbian?” It was in trying to answer questions like
				these that a sense of futility and absurd¬ ity developed. I am not
				a lesbian. I make love only with women. I am in every way what society calls a lesbian. I will call myself and insist
				upon being called a lesbian as long as something called a
				heterosexual or bisexual exists. In all pro¬ bability, 1 am referring
				to a sexuality that will never exist inside me. A simple
				sexuality, without reference to another’s </p>
         <pb n="6"/>
         <p>
				gender. All of this is
				related to the question of circumstance (the time and space I
				live in) and therefore related to strategy (the means of change): an
				area l’m far less clear about than that of alienation. The dilemma for me is that regardless of how I view the role such distinctions serve
				in this society, 1 am brutally oppressed by them, as they have
				been accepted by most everyone. The fact that I am a lesbian has a profound affect on my life. (My job, my family, my
				friends always hang in the balance.) While believing that
				“heterosexual” and “lesbian" are concepts that directly serve to
				oppress us all, I know full well that as a les bian I am intentionally
				persecuted and isolated by this society. The nearest weapon to me
				with which to fight back is the taking of the concept and the word lesbian and claiming it as my own. My continuing to
				work on this issue is the result of that conclusion. The term “artist"
				serves a very similar function as the word "lesbian, though
				the specific effect upon society is quite dif¬ ferent. The term
				"artist" distinguishes between those who are artists and those who
				are not. To me, an artist is a person who works without sham. One
				who works with integrity. The three most basic tools are a sense of self, honesty, and imagin ation. These are also
				three of the greatest enemies of this society. With good
				reason all three of these qualities are suppressed in most
				people at a very early age and replaced with subservience,
				confusion, and conformity. The expressing of oneself creatively
				demands not only a sense of self, honesty and imagination; but
				time...the time to listen, the time to concentrate. To have
				time, is one of the most important instances of privilege (and therefore oppression) in this society. If everyone had
				access to the same opportunities as everyone else—would
				there be such a creature as “artist?” Art would not have to speak
				for everyone if everyone could speak for themselves. Because
				of the privilege accorded to and/or fought for by artists in
				this society, the presumptuous assump¬ tion that some of us
				whether by genius, skill, or inspiration are better able to express
				"our” circumstance—I refuse to call myself or others
				“artists. Accepting money for work and associating with art
				institutions only contributes to the class system of art and
				artists. There are poets, performers, cooks and the like among us.
				These words refer to what we do. But "artist"
				refers to who we are in a context that inescapably implies a difference
				that furthers oppression rather than challenging it. The most important point
				to me, as it refers to this issue, is that just as the words
				“lesbian" and "artist" exist within a context and are affected
				by a circumstance, so does this issue. Marty Pottenger </p>
         <p>
				I want people to
				understand that to be a lesbian feminist is to be undefined,
				complex, groping, newly born, uncategoriz¬ able and
				uncategorized—i.e. not a “Lesbian as she has been culturally defined. I
				work and live for the day when the damnable categories of
				human behavior are gone. And towards this end, I am a part of Heresies and the lesbian issue. I don’t for a moment
				believe that we are presenting (or that we even looked for) any
				answers or final solutions in this issue. There were
				frightening moments when I felt that we had to say it all right
				now or never. As far as l’m concerned that's a reasonable and not
				too paranoid reaction to a culture which "gives us"
				NO place NO voice NO credibility NO trust. We just have to keep
				stretching, shoving, insisting, confronting, and pursuing whatever
				goals we each find most politically important and
				personally fulfilling. I find all the challenge I need in keeping my
				faith in the strength of the combined efforts of feminists
				and in taking seriously my individual acts of survival and growth
				in this death culture. I am committed to photography and the written word, to outrageous and
				humorous art, to women, to the chaos of reconstruction, and to
				publishing as a way to become visible, to be heard and felt
				by no matter how small or select an audience. Su Friedrich </p>
         <p>
				l’ve been painting for
				twelve years—as a feminist I feel l’ve been making “my
				own" art for six of those years—and have identified myself as a
				lesbian for four years. We continue, the work and 1, the
				commitment growing stronger, the relation¬ ship deeper. As 1 am
				less anxious that the work will leave me, or that others won’t
				approve, I step out of my protective world and find myself
				increasingly concerned with feminist political issues. I
				know how my work functions for me, but how does it fit into a
				larger social political view of feminism? I have to admit that,1
				came to this issue with a lot of expec tations. From the
				beginning, I conceived of a whole issue devoted to lesbian art
				as political. I had hoped it would give lesbian artists
				visibility (especially lesbian visual artists who have virtually been
				ignored), create dialogue and community between lesbian visual
				artists and writers, remove the separa¬ tion between lesbian
				art and politics, and bring an art con¬ sciousness to the
				lesbian community and a lesbian conscious¬ ness to the feminist
				art community. Since lesbian artists are so often isolated, I had
				hoped that in this special collective con¬ text we would take
				risks, ask questions, explore ideas, and theorize. Like a
				painter exhibiting for the first time, I wanted to show it all. Now that we have
				worked for almost a year on this issue, 1 have very mixed
				feelings. I think the work presented in this issue is excellent.
				The problem is not the art itself, for much strong work has been
				and is being made by lesbians. The pro¬ blem is what’s
				missing, and what is missing is a context for the work. 1 am
				disappointed that this issue has avoided controver¬ sial material and has
				continued the artistic fear of conscious political discussion.
				We have avoided a larger social political context for our work,
				as though it would somehow interfere with the work or take
				away from its power and meaning. To think politically
				doesn’t mean we can’t see creatively. If artmaking is an
				integral part of feminist revolution as l believe it is, we
				should be asking the following questions: 1. What is the role
				and function of lesbian feminist art in the lesbian movement? 2. What is its role
				and function in the feminist movement? 3. How does lesbian
				feminist art relate to larger social strug¬ gles for change in a
				society where lesbians and others will no longer be
				discriminated against? 4. How does lesbian feminist art affect and transform cul¬ ture? The discussion of
				these questions is far more important than the answers. I believe
				that to be a lesbian artist is in itself poli¬ tical, but I also
				think in these days of homophobic backlash, that we need to push
				further and analyze all patriarchal insti¬ tutions which control
				our lives. I feel that we have not allowed ourselves (because we’re
				artists?) to deal with important issues of lesbian separatism,
				socialist lesbians, lesbian sensibility, the relationship of
				lesbianism to feminism, and the issues of race and class. These
				subjects are not rhetorical, cliched, or irrele¬ vant to artmaking. To me
				they are very real and important in determining the quality
				of lesbian art. Harmony
				Hammond </p>
         <p>
				My impetus to work on
				this issue was rooted in the despera¬ tion and frustration I
				was experiencing working as a lesbian painter within a very
				circumscribed.peer group. 1 had begun to do what most lesbians
				have always done in creating a private world of reinforcement.
				I no longer believe these pockets of isolated support groups
				can bear the strain of what it means to be a lesbian in a
				culture predicated on misogyny and homo¬ phobia. This issue was
				an attempt to seek out lesbian artists and publicize the fact
				of their existence to myself, other les¬ bians and other women.
				The dangers and ramifications of exposing myself and others in a solitary lesbian issue of a magazine whose
				audience and founders are predominately straight are inherent
				and menacing. But no matter what the extent of this issue’s
				token quality I believe that the content: pursue with integrity
				essential questions and possibilities facing all women. K. Webster </p>
         <pb n="7"/>
         <p>
				I believe we are lesbians
				largely because we realize on some level that the demands of heterosexual roles are rooted in a tradition of violence to
				women’s bodies and minds. This tra¬ dition is consciously and unconsciously ritualized; it is large and powerful, life
				determining in fact. Feminism can and must help alter the tradition
				but cannot ultimately transcend it. Some of us have tried to transcend it, could not, don’t believe anybody can at this time,
				and reject it. Equality is a myth that liberal feminism and
				theories of androgyny nourish. Self hatred, doubt, and
				homophobia on some level are operative in all our lives. In spite
				of this, and in defiance of this, I believe lesbianism is
				fundamentally about self-preservation and self¬ love in a culture that
				would have it otherwise. The choice to make art is directly
				aided and energized by such positive impulses. The connections between
				artist’s lives and their artistic creations have historically been acknowledged, probed and even embellished upon.
				However, the very existence of lesbiar lives has inveterately
				been denied. The connections between our lives and our work
				must be constructed and recognized, by ourselves, and
				eventually by others. It is essential that these connections and
				their powerful political ramifications be given credence, and a
				loud, loud voice. Despite my terror at signing my name to this
				magazine, my convictions are strengthened over and over: the presence of lesbians and les- bian artists must be
				affirmed. The third issue of Heresies is an attempt in this
				direction. My personal dedication is to all les¬ bian artists who
				understandably remain silent, in hopes that they won’t always have
				to. Rose Fichtenholtz </p>
         <p>
				This issue of Heresies
				has had a particularly difficult built-in problem. Heresies’
				usual policy is not to print monographs of contemporary artists,
				but the invisibility of lesbian artists and the need for dialogue
				of every kind among lesbians moved us to consider altering
				the monograph policy in various ways. Essentially, because we
				decided to publish only lesbian-made material, the issue
				itself is monographical: Ourselves, our thought, our work. We used a discussion
				and voting process to determine what to publish. The
				question of inclusivity/exclusivity has been a source of trouble for
				us as a collective; it was a problem that we never resolved
				methodically. One direction that I felt the urge to follow was to
				print as much as we could, since this issue could be seen as
				a vehicle by which to strengthen a "women’s
				culture." As it has been defined by some women, a women’s culture is
				based in part on the principle of representa¬ tion of as many of our
				voices as possible with the idea that the many voices make a
				beautiful choir. However, in the end I was committed to print only that material which I felt
				was most powerful. This outlook can be and has been seen as
				an alternative to the “many voices’ method of creating a
				women’s culture. I agree that what 1 deem “powerful"
				is colored by personal biases, some of which must be examined
				closely for their validity. But to try to reflect what was “out
				there” seemed foolish. I felt that it was more honest to print
				what I believe in; that is, not just what I agree with
				ideologically but what agrees with me esthetically Unfortunately the
				usual editorial message is that to deny space to something is to
				imply its worthlessness, and that, converse¬ ly, to print something
				is to assert its worth. As an editor I have reflected only my own biases and opinions. I have done so
				only with the hope that other lesbians will investigate our
				lives true to their own opinions and values—and that we will
				analyze our differences with an eye towards our diverse
				pasts and our collective future. Amy Sillman </p>
         <p>
				l’ve been a lesbian and
				l’ve been a painter for a long time. have little respect for
				rhetoric, politics that squeeze the life’s blood out of artists,
				or theories of lesbian sensibility or les¬ bian imagery formulated
				out of daydreams. I
				don’t like being isolated in this magazine because my les¬ bian artist sisters out
				there refuse to come out. Backlash is on its way, but we don’t
				even need backlash—we have the sanct- ity of the closet. l’d like to personally
				dedicate this issue to all the women who we know are
				lesbians and who have made it big in the last forty years—as
				artists, as dealers, and as intellectuals—for their steadfastness in
				the denial of their queerness. The starkness of their
				lives led me to cherish honest living and to search for an
				alternate route for making art. I want to share what 1 have learned in my twenty years of being a painter and a
				lesbian with lesbians who want a strong identity as artists. I
				am interested in work. I am first a painter. 1 am not interested in
				formulating politics or in promoting a lesbian universe. I am
				in this despite my doubts about the pro¬ ductivity of
				collective enterprise and despite the distance it takes me from my work.
					Louise Fishman </p>
         <p>
				When I am making a work
				of art I am making it first and foremost therapeutically for myself, and I am alone in my studio and feeling
				usually very lonely. At this time there is only a vague sense that
				it is also for other women artists and women who like to look
				at art. And even when 1 have finished working on it and it is
				an expression of my own formulated and particular visual
				bias, it is still not yet complete. Women come to my studio and
				look at it and see things that I was too close to see and the
				painting’s meaning becomes larger. Anc still it is not yet
				finished. It seasons awhile in front of its small audiences and
				insistently sits before them and I bring people in front of it and say,
				“Yes, this is my art; this is my experience, until in some way it
				is recognized, analyzed and absorbed. Then it is finished.
				It is finished when it goes public, is recog¬ nized, given meaning.
					Women have managed
				somehow to survive in a woman- hating culture, but rarely have they found ways to complete expression in the
				culture. We know better than most that the personal is political
				because when we have insisted upon our personal viewpoint,
				when we have insisted upon our art, we have been burned,
				mutilated, raped and put away—at best ridiculed. Exposure,
				even sometimes to each other, is danger¬ ous; fraught with
				memories of past violence, visions of future violence, the feeling
				that we will be considered crazy if we let others know who we are
				and what we think. We have no his torical or political
				context to decide which parts of us remain intact after suffering
				consistent negation and brutality. Who we choose as an
				audience is of vital consideration as long as exposure is
				dangerous. I sign my name to this issue with a great sense of
				purpose as well as real trepidation. Every day l am aware that
				people think I am crazy because I am a les¬ bian and that violence
				may be done to me because of it. This will continue long
				after male institutions grant us our civil rights. It will
				continue until we make the reality of our exper¬ ience clear. Women
				have often had strength in the private domain, are safer
				there. When we have brought our experience, our work, our ideas to
				the world we have been repudiated and endangered. It is time to be particular and rigorous in our language and ideas,
				to articulate our needs and biases, and to insist, “Yes, this is
				our art; yes, this is our experience,” in a voice that can not be
				refuted. Christine Wade
