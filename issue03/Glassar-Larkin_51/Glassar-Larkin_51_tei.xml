					<l>Untitled</l>
					<l>Some Unsaid Things</l>
					<l>1 have not been there many times.</l>
					<l>I was not going to say</l>
					<l>On two separate occasions l entered the surroundings</l>
					<l>how you lay with me</l>
					<l>Though many times I thought I was at that place.</l>
					<l>There were the children, amorous, and l</l>
					<l>nor where your hands went</l>
					<l>who could have been their mother,</l>
					<l>&amp; left their light impressions</l>
					<l>Lovesick with them.</l>
					<l>nor whose face was white</l>
					<l>Though restless and seeking many places,</l>
					<l>as a splash of moonlight</l>
					<l>we observe more than the bird does, with more longings.</l>
					<l>hough I too have a home,</l>
					<l>nor who spilled the wine</l>
					<l>I find comfort in denying it.</l>
					<l>nor whose blood stained the sheet</l>
					<l>There are many homes.</l>
					<l>They choose you.</l>
					<l>nor which one of us wept</l>
					<l>to set the dark bed rocking</l>
					<l>Perhaps I would give much for assurance.</l>
					<l>I have never been offered a bargain.</l>
					<l>nor what you took me for</l>
					<l>An old game played by two persons throwing three dice,</l>
					<l>nor what I took you for</l>
					<l>his too is passage.</l>
					<l>In my house</l>
					<l>nor how your fingertips</l>
					<l>the passage from the door leads to the kitchen</l>
					<l>in me were roots</l>
					<l>then off to the bath.</l>
					<l>I take long baths</l>
					<l>light roots torn leaves put down¬</l>
					<l>putting milk on my face</l>
					<l>nor what you tore from me</l>
					<l>leaving the door open to the smells of the kitchen.</l>
					<l>But it is all in passing</l>
					<l>nor what confusion came</l>
					<l>in a hasty manner</l>
					<l>of our twin names</l>
					<l>cursorily</l>
					<l>that 1 continue.</l>
					<l>nor will I say whose body</l>
					<l>opened, sucked, whispered</l>
					<l>Carole Glasser</l>
					<l>like the ocean, unbalancing</l>
					<l>what had seemed a safe position</l>
