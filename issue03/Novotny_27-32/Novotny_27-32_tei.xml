				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_21' n='N021'/>place. Just before or very soon after her birth in March,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_22' n='N022'/>1866, her father, an Englishman named Edward Munn,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_23' n='N023'/>deserted her mother and vanished home to London,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_24' n='N024'/>never to be heard from again. The abandoned Mrs.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_25' n='N025'/>Munn, with her small baby and no means of support,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_26' n='N026'/>returned to her parents&apos; Victorian cottage on the east
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_27' n='N027'/>shore of Staten Island. She stopped using her married
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_28' n='N028'/>surname, and her bitterness toward her former husband
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_29' n='N029'/>communicated itself to her daughter. Small playmates
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_30' n='N030'/>in the neighborhood soon discovered that one sure way
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_31' n='N031'/>to enrage the little girl known as Alice Austen was to
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_32' n='N032'/>call her &quot;Alice Munn.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_33' n='N033'/>Alice’s strong personality was formed in the 1860’s
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_34' n='N034'/>and 1870’s in her grandparents’ home, where she was
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_35' n='N035'/>the only child in a household also shared by her mother,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_36' n='N036'/>her Aunt Minnie and Minnie’s husband, and her young

				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_38' n='N038'/>maids. She was the center of attention for all these
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_39' n='N039'/>adults, who played games with her, humored her fits of
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_40' n='N040'/>temper, encouraged her natural abilities at sports and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_41' n='N041'/>mechanical skills, and helped to mold the unusual
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_42' n='N042'/>young woman Alice became.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_43' n='N043'/>It was Aunt Minnie’s husband, a Danish-born sea

				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_48' n='N048'/>Although she was only ten years old, she was patient
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_49' n='N049'/>and intelligent, and strong enough to hold the camera
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_50' n='N050'/>steadily on its tripod; her hands were naturally skillful

				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_4_1' n='N004'/>toy. During his frequent visits home, he showed his
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_5_1' n='N005'/>enthusiastic niece how to use chemicals to develop the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_6_1' n='N006'/>negative images on the glass plates she exposed, and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_7_1' n='N007'/>how to make prints from them. He and the Captain
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_8_1' n='N008'/>were probably the people who helped her further by
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_9_1' n='N009'/>installing, in an upstairs storage closet, a tiny home-built
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_10_1' n='N010'/>darkroom (which can still be seen today, with its deep
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_11_1' n='N011'/>shelves and remnants of Victorian linoleum, in the city¬
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_12_1' n='N012'/>owned house on Staten Island).
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_13_1' n='N013'/>Young Alice spent hours on end in the darkroom,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_14_1' n='N014'/>developing plates and toning and fixing her prints.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_15_1' n='N015'/>Because there was no running water in the house when
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_16_1' n='N016'/>she was young, she carried the plates and prints down to
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_17_1' n='N017'/>the pump in the garden, to rinse them in basins of icy
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_18_1' n='N018'/>cold water, winter and summer, sometimes changing the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_19_1' n='N019'/>rinse water as many as twenty-five times. By the time
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_20_1' n='N020'/>she was eighteen years old (the earliest year from which
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_21_1' n='N021'/>any of her photographs survive), Alice Austen was an
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_22_1' n='N022'/>experienced photographer with professional standards.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_23_1' n='N023'/>It is worth emphasizing how early this was in photo-
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_24_1' n='N024'/>graphic history. Alfred Stieglitz (1864-1946) had only
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_25_1' n='N025'/>just exposed his first negative by the time Alice’s skill
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_26_1' n='N026'/>was perfected. Alice began to take photographs some
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_27_1' n='N027'/>twenty years before Edward Steichen (1879-1973)
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_28_1' n='N028'/>bought his first camera in Milwaukee and twenty years
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_29_1' n='N029'/>before Eugene Atget (1857-1927) began to record the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_30_1' n='N030'/>streets and people of Paris.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_31_1' n='N031'/>The photographer whose work most closely resembles
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_32_1' n='N032'/>Alice Austen’s, Frances Benjamin Johnston, began
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_33_1' n='N033'/>working as a photojournalist in Washington, D.C., in
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_34_1' n='N034'/>the 1890’s, when she and Alice were both in their thir-
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_35_1' n='N035'/>ties. These two women probably never met, and may
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_36_1' n='N036'/>not even have heard of each other, but the similarities
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_37_1' n='N037'/>between them are striking. Johnston never married, and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_38_1' n='N038'/>it is quite likely that she too was a lesbian, although “her
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_39_1' n='N039'/>private life remains hidden behind a veil of Victorian
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_40_1' n='N040'/>manners, as one biographer has written. Like Austen,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_41_1' n='N041'/>she was well-connected socially and much-traveled,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_42_1' n='N042'/>unconventional in many ways according to the norms
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_43_1' n='N043'/>of her society, a strong and independent woman whose
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_44_1' n='N044'/>career also lasted into the 1930’s. Johnston became
				<lb facs='#facs_31_region_1674937857403_717_tl_45_1' n='N045'/>known for her portraits of the famous (Susan B.

				<lb facs='#facs_34_region_1674937887872_732_tl_34' n='N034'/>appreciated them as they were—inquisitive and busy,

				<lb facs='#facs_34_region_1674937887872_732_tl_45' n='N045'/>to develop the strength their daily activities required.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_region_1674937887872_732_tl_46' n='N046'/>The fact that Alice was a woman, often photograph-

				<lb facs='#facs_34_region_1674937887872_732_tl_60' n='N060'/>still—as dashing young men about town. Alice Austen
				<lb facs='#facs_34_region_1674937887872_732_tl_61' n='N061'/>did not waste any time pondering the essence of

				<lb facs='#facs_34_region_1674937887872_732_tl_63' n='N063'/>The fact that she was a woman also means that it was

				<lb facs='#facs_34_region_1674937887872_732_tl_16_1' n='N016'/>her close friends. Victorian society was not strong
