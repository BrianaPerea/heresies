				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_2' n='N002'/>ing about it. The structure is intuitive in conception.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_3' n='N003'/>Analysis, abstraction, and my talking about it comes
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_4' n='N004'/>later. That is why my films are not formalist; that is,
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_5' n='N005'/>they do not strictly adhere to an a priori rule of form,
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_6' n='N006'/>but instead, spring from my intuitive gut experiences
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_7' n='N007'/>and so are phenomenological. The form is directly de¬
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_8' n='N008'/>termined by the content. A lot of words. My films begin
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_9' n='N009'/>in what I call &quot;feeling images, an inseparable unity of
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_10' n='N010'/>emotion and image of thought/idea/image and internal
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_11' n='N011'/>bodily states of excitement.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_12' n='N012'/>I am going to talk about time and imaging in some of
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_13' n='N013'/>my films: how they were created (what gave rise to the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_14' n='N014'/>image language that became screen language) and how
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_15' n='N015'/>they differ from each other in time structure and image
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_16' n='N016'/>content. I will talk about the following films: I WAS/I
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_17' n='N017'/>AM (1973) which combines real time and fantasy time;
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_18' n='N018'/>(1974) which is a ritual naming film based on sub¬
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_19' n='N019'/>verted time; Menses (1974) a satire of the Walt Disney
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_20' n='N020'/>type movie ritual of menstruation; and Dyketactics,
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_21' n='N021'/>which can be seen as erotic time.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_22' n='N022'/>Film is a projection of still pictures of images or non¬
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_23' n='N023'/>images (color or non-color) usually at the standard pro¬

				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_25' n='N025'/>ond. So from the beginning, film is both illusion (the illu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_26' n='N026'/>sion of movement from the rapid succession of image or
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_27' n='N027'/>non-image) and “reality” (the progression of the cellu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_28' n='N028'/>loid strip through the projection system). Within this
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_29' n='N029'/>context the experience of time in I WAS/I AM is my
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_30' n='N030'/>attempt to combine “real&quot; time and fantasy time. I be¬
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_31' n='N031'/>lieve these usually separated experiences are part of the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_32' n='N032'/>same life experience. If we fantasize, as we all do, if we

				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_35' n='N035'/>which is composed of all this simultaneous imaging.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_36' n='N036'/>Tempo, or the ratio of these projected stills, is another

				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_39' n='N039'/>tempted to build film scores of increasing and decreasing

				<lb facs='#facs_89_region_1675013785674_1501_tl_41' n='N041'/>tions. The central image of the chain is two image

				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_3' n='N003'/>the poetic film. It is a transcription of that state of being
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_4' n='N004'/>where the intention or &quot;intensification is carried out not
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_5' n='N005'/>by action but by the illumination of that moment.” The
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_6' n='N006'/>illumination of the moment (the continuous present)
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_7' n='N007'/>means the film’s construct is vertical rather than hori¬
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_8' n='N008'/>zontal. It is a poetic construct of developing moments
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_9' n='N009'/>each one held together by an emotion or meaning they
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_10' n='N010'/>have in common rather than logical action. I talk about
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_11' n='N011'/>these images as feeling-images, one calls or recalls an¬
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_12' n='N012'/>other, until a great pyramid is built of a particular feel¬
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_13' n='N013'/>ing or an elucidation of the multi-dimensions of that
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_14' n='N014'/>feeling, that emotion state. I think Deren and I are talk¬
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_15' n='N015'/>ing about the same thing. She says, it is “the logic of
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_16' n='N016'/>central emotion or idea that attracts to itself disparate
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_17' n='N017'/>images which contain the central core they have in com¬
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_18' n='N018'/>mon. Film is essentially a montage and therefore by
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_19' n='N019'/>nature a poetic medium.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_20' n='N020'/>We have a long and continuing tradition of great
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_21' n='N021'/>women poets. It surprises me then that women’s cinema
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_22' n='N022'/>in many cases continues and copies the linear, narrative

				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_29' n='N029'/>the different hemispheric centers of the brain. The left is
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_30' n='N030'/>rational, linear, analytical, and related to speech and
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_31' n='N031'/>words. The right is the center of artistic, musical and
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_32' n='N032'/>spatial perception and I might add, the hemisphere that
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_33' n='N033'/>allows us to experience simultaneous and continuous

				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_36' n='N036'/>intuition, feeling and imaging. I suggest that the right
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_37' n='N037'/>hemisphere is dominant in forming the image clusters in
				<lb facs='#facs_90_region_1675013805674_1513_tl_38' n='N038'/>my films and in my dreams. In Psychosynthesis (1975) I
