				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>stitutions that help shape our lives. Homo¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>phobia is suffered by heterosexual and lesbian
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>women, and is one of the major causes of divi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>sion within the feminist movement. Lesbianism
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>is often used as a &quot;discipline&quot;&apos; on heterosexual
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>women to keep them “in line&quot;&apos; and under

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>the norms that govern acceptable behavior
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>which is not to be taken lightly by lesbian or
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>heterosexual women. The family, the church
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>and the school are the primary institutions that

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>and interpret women’s behavior as &quot;female in¬

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>socialization, and it is crucial in the develop¬

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>one&apos;s own sex. Here children are exposed to

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>them as their own. In children&apos;s play one can
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>hear the tapes played back by children (i.e.,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>Good little girls don’t do that&quot;&apos;). Play is one of

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>tions. Elementary school educators define the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>goals that serve as a basic guideline for the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>school curriculum. One of the goals is to pro¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>vide personal, social, moral, educational and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>vocational guidelines. The elementary school in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>this society has the responsibility of helping the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>six- to twelve-year-old learn the developmental
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>task that goes with that age.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>From a sexual orientation perspective, the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>developmental task for age six to twelve is
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>learning an appropriate sexual role. In the case
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>of the female, sex roles are dictated in elemen¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>tary school and many times go unchallenged as
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>subtle sexist philosophies are interwoven into
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>the curriculum. Even though most elementary
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>schools are coeducational, some classroom and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>playground activities are sex-typed. A classic
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>example: teacher to class, “1 need a strong boy
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>to move a desk. Mary, would you water the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>plants?&quot; Elementary school reading books con¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>tinue to designate woman&apos;s primary role as

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>politician. While the defined roles of women
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>mentioned are not any less important than
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>those given to men, they are limited and do not
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>lend themselves to women participating in the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>major decision-making arena of society.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>Secondary schools continue to propagate the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l32' n='N032'/>&quot;functional role theory&quot; through sex education
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l33' n='N033'/>classes that deal only superficially with the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l34' n='N034'/>needs of women to be sexually competent out¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l2' n='N002'/>What are the myths about lesbians?
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>1. A woman is a lesbian because she possesses
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>a natural defect.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>&quot;female negative inferior“&apos;)
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l6' n='N006'/>2. A lesbian is emotionally unstable, sexually
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l7' n='N007'/>frustrated, self-indulgent and morally de¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>generate.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>(&quot;&apos;deviant negative inferior&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>3. A lesbian is anti-revolutionary, hates men,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>suffers from penis envy and is a security
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>risk.

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>4. A lesbian wears men&apos;s clothes, is sexually
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>aggressive and physically unattractive.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>&quot;deviant negative inferior&apos;&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>5. A lesbian is afraid of men based on her past
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>experiences and has inner conflicts because
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>she needs a man.

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>These myths about lesbians make up the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>symptoms of homophobia, whose basic element
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>is fear. This unfounded fear produces a chain
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>of defensive reactions that serve to alienate
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>women from each other thus weakening com¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>munication between women. Homophobia is
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>suffered by lesbians and heterosexual women
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>and is manifested in their oppressive behavior
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>when addressing themselves to the lesbian life¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>style. It is not uncommon that the oppressed
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>incorporate the values of the oppressor to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>maintain certain kinds of control. Women who
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>subscribe to this behavior are said to be male¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>identified, in that they share the same views
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>about women that men do. These women may
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>fear a loss of sexual power or have uncon¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>sciously accepted the &quot;female negative infer¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>their relationships with other women. In the

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>serves as a tool for stifling economic growth

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>Third World men in the society.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>While some lesbians do see themselves as
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>sexually aggressive, their behavior cannot be
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>inked to the high incidence of sexual violence
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>suffered by women and young girls. All les¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>bians are not separatist, or feminist, or unat¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>with a man. She may or may not wear men&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>clothing, or drive a truck, or spit between her

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>The true lesbian sees herself no less than her
