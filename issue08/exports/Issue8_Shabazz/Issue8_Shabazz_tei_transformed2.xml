				Homophobia: Myths and Realities
			</p>
         <p>
				Naeemah Shabazz
				O 1979
			</p>
         <p>
				This essay will speak to homophobia and
				identify some of the basic institutions that help
				formulate our sexual politics and reinforce soci¬
				etal myths about lesbians. Homophobia is a
				social illness characterized by the fear of being
				defined as, associated with, mistakenly identi¬
				fied for a homosexual. At the New York As-
				sociation of Black Psychologists Fourth Annual
				Spring Conference, Yvonne Flowers defined
				homophobia to the conference as “an exagger¬
				ated fear of homosexuals. This exaggerated
				fear is based on myths propagated by those in¬
				stitutions that help shape our lives. Homo¬
				phobia is suffered by heterosexual and lesbian
				women, and is one of the major causes of divi¬
				sion within the feminist movement. Lesbianism
				is often used as a "discipline"' on heterosexual
				women to keep them “in line"' and under
				control.
				Lesbianism will be defined here as an intim¬
				ate relationship between women on the con¬
				scious level; elements of this intimate relation¬
				ship being love, sensitivity, spiritual nurturing,
				validation of self, emotional and psychological
				growth.
				A bird's-eye view of the sexual socialization
				of women in this society shows the kind of in¬
				put our basic institutions have in determining
				the norms that govern acceptable behavior
				which is not to be taken lightly by lesbian or
				heterosexual women. The family, the church
				and the school are the primary institutions that
				reinforce a "functional role theory"' for women
				and interpret women’s behavior as "female in¬
				ferior negative"' and, for lesbians, "deviant in¬
				ferior negative.
				The home is the primary foundation for
				socialization, and it is crucial in the develop¬
				ment of sexual awareness and acceptance of
				one's own sex. Here children are exposed to
				the views of parents and very early internalize
				them as their own. In children's play one can
				hear the tapes played back by children (i.e.,
				Good little girls don’t do that"'). Play is one of
				the ways a child forms a repertoire of the dos
				and don’ts of the already-existing society. The
				child continues to internalize and imitate the
				parents' views and behavior until other surro¬
				gate socializers are introduced, such as baby¬
			</p>
         <p>
				sitters, relatives, peer groups and other institu¬
				tions. Elementary school educators define the
				goals that serve as a basic guideline for the
				school curriculum. One of the goals is to pro¬
				vide personal, social, moral, educational and
				vocational guidelines. The elementary school in
				this society has the responsibility of helping the
				six- to twelve-year-old learn the developmental
				task that goes with that age.
				From a sexual orientation perspective, the
				developmental task for age six to twelve is
				learning an appropriate sexual role. In the case
				of the female, sex roles are dictated in elemen¬
				tary school and many times go unchallenged as
				subtle sexist philosophies are interwoven into
				the curriculum. Even though most elementary
				schools are coeducational, some classroom and
				playground activities are sex-typed. A classic
				example: teacher to class, “1 need a strong boy
				to move a desk. Mary, would you water the
				plants?" Elementary school reading books con¬
				tinue to designate woman's primary role as
				mother-homemaker, teacher, nurse and volun¬
				teer service worker while defining man's role
				as breadwinner doctor lawyer shopowner and
				politician. While the defined roles of women
				mentioned are not any less important than
				those given to men, they are limited and do not
				lend themselves to women participating in the
				major decision-making arena of society.
				Secondary schools continue to propagate the
				"functional role theory" through sex education
				classes that deal only superficially with the
				needs of women to be sexually competent out¬
				side of the realm of motherhood. Undergradu¬
				ate and graduate schools continue to operate
				under the "female negative inferior"' philoso¬
				phy in the areas of faculty distribution and stu¬
				dent admission. Ann Sutherland Harris, in her
				essay "The Second Sex in Academe," quoted
				President Nathan Pusey of Harvard, reacting to
				the possibility of the draft reducing male en¬
				rollment: "We shall be left with the blind, the
				lame, and the women."' Harris asserts that
				the excuse for limiting its female undergradu¬
				ate enrollment to 25% of the total is that there
				is insufficient accommodation for women."
				The church has equal input into the sexual
				socialization of women. It asserts that woman,

				female negative inferior"')
				These myths about lesbians make up the
				symptoms of homophobia, whose basic element
				is fear. This unfounded fear produces a chain
				of defensive reactions that serve to alienate
				women from each other thus weakening com¬
				munication between women. Homophobia is
				suffered by lesbians and heterosexual women
				and is manifested in their oppressive behavior
				when addressing themselves to the lesbian life¬
				style. It is not uncommon that the oppressed
				incorporate the values of the oppressor to
				maintain certain kinds of control. Women who
				subscribe to this behavior are said to be male¬
				identified, in that they share the same views
				about women that men do. These women may
				fear a loss of sexual power or have uncon¬
				sciously accepted the "female negative infer¬
				ior"' concept of themselves and act it out in
				their relationships with other women. In the
				corporate world the male-identified woman
				serves as a tool for stifling economic growth
				and creativity among women. One of the con¬
				cerns of the Third World Lesbian Feminist
				Movement ks the result of the socialization
				process that goes with upward mobility and its
				relationship to the oppressed becoming the op¬
				pressor which takes its toll on Third World
				esbian feminists.
				One of the greatest fears of the homophobic
				heterosexual woman is to be remotely connect¬
				ed to a lesbian in word, action or deed. To her
				it may mean a loss ot status among men, a
				destiny she cannot bear. It is the man who has
				defined her nature and given her a purpose in
				life. Homophobia serves as a defense mechan¬
				ism for she may be paranoid about admitting to
				her own sexual experiences as a child and the
				implications of lesbianism. Her inner conflict
				relating to her sexual self may result in a
			</p>
         <p>
				fanatical approach to heterosexuality, and she
				finds it easy to attach a moral judgment on les¬
				bianism. The homophobic lesbian or hetero¬
				sexual woman may doubt the political aware¬
				ness and intellectual ability of lesbians in ex¬
				change for prevailing stereotypes. She may
				support competition as inherent in men, and
				limit her participation in a collective decision¬
				making environment. She may also distrust the
				feminist movement, see it as counter-revolu¬
				tionary, destructive, and may assist at some
				level in the attempt to sabotage the women's
				movement, based on fear and sexual contra¬
				dictions.
				Homophobia leaves a woman open to sexist
				manipulation, mind control, and can result in
				socioeconomic genocide for women.
				Some of the prevailing myths about lesbians
				need to be put into the proper perspective. The
				esbian suffers no more emotional stress, sex¬
				ual frustration and inner conflict than her
				heterosexual sister. In fact much could be said
				about the maturity of the lesbian who relates to
				her sexual politics as having relevance outside
				of the "functional role theory." Third World
				lesbians, while not anti-race or counter-revolu¬
				tionary, do question the role of the Third World
				woman in the revolution as it relates to the
				female negative inferior"' concept held by
				Third World men in the society.
				While some lesbians do see themselves as
				sexually aggressive, their behavior cannot be
				inked to the high incidence of sexual violence
				suffered by women and young girls. All les¬
				bians are not separatist, or feminist, or unat¬
				tractive, or suffering from penis envy, or
				secretly craving for a man. A lesbian may or
				may not have had a meaningful relationship
				with a man. She may or may not wear men's
				clothing, or drive a truck, or spit between her
				teeth, or live in the Village, or wear purple.
				The true lesbian sees herself no less than her
				male or female counterpart, but understands
				the implications of the distinct difference in the
				species as it relates to the spiritual develop¬
				ment of the individual. One could say that the
				lesbian has turned "woman love"' inside; sub¬
				sequently the content became the form. She
				receives her emotional, psychological and
				spiritual nurturing from woman, and credits her
				highly developed sensitivity to that energy.
