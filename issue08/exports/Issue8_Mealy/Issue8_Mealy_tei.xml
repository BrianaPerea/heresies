				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>would like to present a brief outline on
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>some important aspects of a subject about
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>which l’m most concerned—the deletion of a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>correct portrayal of Black women in film. l&apos;ve
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>been in many political discussions around this
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>topic and as a Black woman l’ve gone to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>theaters only to be insulted by what l&apos;ve
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>watched on the screen. 1 have thus internalized
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>the topic based on having an understanding of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>my own oppression as a Black woman. One film
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>made me so angry 1 wanted to leave before the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>first half. The film was Which Way is Up.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>The comedy of Richard Pryor became the rage
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>of Rosemari Mealy. 1 was so busy verbally ana¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>lyzing the sexist attitude of Pryor towards Black
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>women that 1 made a few folks move to other
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>seats. ! applauded the Chicana sister when she
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>drove off, with his child and another man leav¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>ing him to his petit bourgeois sexist antics. For
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>me that film was a personification of the sexist
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>decadence exemplified in &quot;contemporary&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>Black film.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>Since the early 70’s contemporary Black films
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>have done little or nothing to depict the correct
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>image of Black people, much less that of Black
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>women.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>Some years ago, 1 read Christopher Caud¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>well&apos;s IIlusion and Reality. Caudwell was a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>European scientist, writer, and poet. My
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>respect for his writings increased when
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>learned that he was also an anti-fascist who
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>died fighting as such. Caudwell saw art as
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>adapting the individual psyche to the environ¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>ment, and fas] therefore one of the conditions of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>the development of society.&quot; 1 agree with that
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>perspective. Therefore, 1 cannot talk about the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>characterization of Black women in film without
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>first understanding the characterization of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>Black people historically in film. And we all
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>know that racism and sexism permeated that
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>characterization.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>The Black Scholar so amply summarized this
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>characterization in its May 1976 issue:
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>The Hollywood film industry has historically
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>been a chief arbiter of American cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>values and images. Hollywood has fashioned
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l47' n='N047'/>and purveyed a celluloid American Dream—a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>dream that has been extremely profitable for
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l49' n='N049'/>the white film-makers, and which has molded
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l50' n='N050'/>and titillated the psyches of millions and mil¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l51' n='N051'/>ions of moviegoers.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>Hollywood movies created and popularized
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>American heroes and villains—prototypically,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>the white cowboy-adventurer-secret agent por¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>trayed in righteous combat against treacherous
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>Indians, Asians or Blacks. (And when the vil¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>lain was not actually dark-skinned, it was cus¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>tomary for him to wear a black hat and/or
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>coat.) Movies have thus been a major institu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>tional and ideological prop of American racism:
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>distorting history, inculcating racist values and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>stereotypes, and largely excluding non-whites
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>from participation in film-making.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>The individual psyche of the Black theater
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>audience has adapted to a dominant theme so
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>prevalent in capitalist society. Violence then
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>becomes the dominant theme in all social rela¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>tionships. The perpetuation of racist and sexist
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>stereotyping in film exacerbates the violence
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>theme. Violence is an active phenomenon.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>Black women in film portray that violence; in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>reality, they are the victims of such in social
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>and familial relationships—thousands of Black
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>women were victims of domestic violence in the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>United States last year. The links between
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>reality and the norms acceptable to institutions
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>of society perpetuate the characterization within
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>the film industry. Who are the heroes for our
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>children? The pimp in The Mack, the super¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>niggers as portrayed by Fred Williamson and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>Jim Brown. What ingratiates these films to the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>bourgeoisie is the role most often portrayed by
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l32' n='N032'/>Black women—that of the victim as culprit. The
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l33' n='N033'/>extent of the Black woman&apos;s liberation on the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l34' n='N034'/>screen is based on her willingness to take low,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l35' n='N035'/>as well as how often she gives it up. From the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l36' n='N036'/>historical perspective, the culprit has been the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l37' n='N037'/>mammy, the tragic mulatto, the mammy-matri¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l38' n='N038'/>arch and the seductress.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l39' n='N039'/>In the March/April 1973 issue of The Black
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l40' n='N040'/>Scholar, Edward Mapp adequately describes
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l41' n='N041'/>the historical role of Black women in film. He
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l42' n='N042'/>cites only one example of Hollywood&apos;s portrayal
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l43' n='N043'/>of the Black woman&apos;s experience as a possible
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l44' n='N044'/>take off point for extending a positive approach
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l45' n='N045'/>to Black women in film. He cites Lady Sings
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l46' n='N046'/>the Blues (1972) for its depiction of the Black
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l47' n='N047'/>female’s contribution to American culture and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l48' n='N048'/>art. But even this is a totally inaccurate por¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l49' n='N049'/>trayal of the real life of Billie Holiday. 1 say we
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l50' n='N050'/>need films about Lucy Parsons, Black woman

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l6' n='N006'/>In the 70’s, spurred on by the cultural na¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>mage, but the very first Black multi-million
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>dollar film set the tone for what was later to be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>Hollywood&apos;s economic bail-out and a contem¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>porary version of Green Pastures, where
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>porkchops and watermelon were replaced by
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>butts, bosoms and gun-toting niggers—black¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>faced versions of what was once the exclusive
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>property of the white, male, racist and sexist
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>dominated industry. Sweet Sweetback&apos;s Bad¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>ass Song was the film—a nightmare from the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>mind of Melvin Van Peebles.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>The initial screen image presented by the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>film of the “New Black Image,&quot; even before
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>the film title was introduced, is a Black woman
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>prostitute committing statutory rape on a 10-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>year-old Black child. And it is significant that
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>the first image was created by a Black male.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>But lest we fall into our bourgeois or feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>trap of the simplistic notion of Black men
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>against Black women, we must define what
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>kind of man Van Peebles is—what is his class
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>attitude? It was always defined by him in terms

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>of money!!! To be sure, the brother was talent¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>ed and witty. He even got across the racist
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>Hollywood unions to make this flick, claiming
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>he was giving Black people jobs, providing
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>them with technical skills and film exposure.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>But how many of these non-union Black men
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>and women were to reap a significant portion of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>the more than 312 million in profits? And what

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>tragic mulattos. They were now in the modern

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>Greer, Vonetta McGee, and Pamela Dodson.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>They headed the money-making movies with
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>their large breasts, long legs and pretty eyes
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>rather than with their acting abilities. Or we
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>saw the bit players whose primary acting tal¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>heroes like Richard Roundtree. Again, these
