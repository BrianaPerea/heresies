				Some Reflections on Black Women in Film
			</p>
         <p>
				Rosemari Mealy
				O 1979
			</p>
         <p>
				would like to present a brief outline on
				some important aspects of a subject about
				which l’m most concerned—the deletion of a
				correct portrayal of Black women in film. l've
				been in many political discussions around this
				topic and as a Black woman l’ve gone to
				theaters only to be insulted by what l've
				watched on the screen. 1 have thus internalized
				the topic based on having an understanding of
				my own oppression as a Black woman. One film
				made me so angry 1 wanted to leave before the
				first half. The film was Which Way is Up.
				The comedy of Richard Pryor became the rage
				of Rosemari Mealy. 1 was so busy verbally ana¬
				lyzing the sexist attitude of Pryor towards Black
				women that 1 made a few folks move to other
				seats. ! applauded the Chicana sister when she
				drove off, with his child and another man leav¬
				ing him to his petit bourgeois sexist antics. For
				me that film was a personification of the sexist
				decadence exemplified in "contemporary'
				Black film.
				Since the early 70’s contemporary Black films
				have done little or nothing to depict the correct
				image of Black people, much less that of Black
				women.
				Some years ago, 1 read Christopher Caud¬
				well's IIlusion and Reality. Caudwell was a
				European scientist, writer, and poet. My
				respect for his writings increased when
				learned that he was also an anti-fascist who
				died fighting as such. Caudwell saw art as
				adapting the individual psyche to the environ¬
				ment, and fas] therefore one of the conditions of
				the development of society." 1 agree with that
				perspective. Therefore, 1 cannot talk about the
				characterization of Black women in film without
				first understanding the characterization of
				Black people historically in film. And we all
				know that racism and sexism permeated that
				characterization.
				The Black Scholar so amply summarized this
				characterization in its May 1976 issue:
				The Hollywood film industry has historically
				been a chief arbiter of American cultural
				values and images. Hollywood has fashioned
				and purveyed a celluloid American Dream—a
				dream that has been extremely profitable for
				the white film-makers, and which has molded
				and titillated the psyches of millions and mil¬
				ions of moviegoers.
			</p>
         <p>
				Hollywood movies created and popularized
				American heroes and villains—prototypically,
				the white cowboy-adventurer-secret agent por¬
				trayed in righteous combat against treacherous
				Indians, Asians or Blacks. (And when the vil¬
				lain was not actually dark-skinned, it was cus¬
				tomary for him to wear a black hat and/or
				coat.) Movies have thus been a major institu¬
				tional and ideological prop of American racism:
				distorting history, inculcating racist values and
				stereotypes, and largely excluding non-whites
				from participation in film-making.
				The individual psyche of the Black theater
				audience has adapted to a dominant theme so
				prevalent in capitalist society. Violence then
				becomes the dominant theme in all social rela¬
				tionships. The perpetuation of racist and sexist
				stereotyping in film exacerbates the violence
				theme. Violence is an active phenomenon.
				Black women in film portray that violence; in
				reality, they are the victims of such in social
				and familial relationships—thousands of Black
				women were victims of domestic violence in the
				United States last year. The links between
				reality and the norms acceptable to institutions
				of society perpetuate the characterization within
				the film industry. Who are the heroes for our
				children? The pimp in The Mack, the super¬
				niggers as portrayed by Fred Williamson and
				Jim Brown. What ingratiates these films to the
				bourgeoisie is the role most often portrayed by
				Black women—that of the victim as culprit. The
				extent of the Black woman's liberation on the
				screen is based on her willingness to take low,
				as well as how often she gives it up. From the
				historical perspective, the culprit has been the
				mammy, the tragic mulatto, the mammy-matri¬
				arch and the seductress.
				In the March/April 1973 issue of The Black
				Scholar, Edward Mapp adequately describes
				the historical role of Black women in film. He
				cites only one example of Hollywood's portrayal
				of the Black woman's experience as a possible
				take off point for extending a positive approach
				to Black women in film. He cites Lady Sings
				the Blues (1972) for its depiction of the Black
				female’s contribution to American culture and
				art. But even this is a totally inaccurate por¬
				trayal of the real life of Billie Holiday. 1 say we
				need films about Lucy Parsons, Black woman
				worker/labor organizer; the 1969 Charleston

				Women Hospital workers, Ida b. Wells, Beulah
				Sanders, Fannie Lou Hammer, Ella Baker and
				Florence Wrice, ILGWU organizer; we need
				more films like Nothing But a Man, which
				creates a positive image in a negative context.
				In the 70’s, spurred on by the cultural na¬
				tionalist movement, we were to produce a new
				mage, but the very first Black multi-million
				dollar film set the tone for what was later to be
				Hollywood's economic bail-out and a contem¬
				porary version of Green Pastures, where
				porkchops and watermelon were replaced by
				butts, bosoms and gun-toting niggers—black¬
				faced versions of what was once the exclusive
				property of the white, male, racist and sexist
				dominated industry. Sweet Sweetback's Bad¬
				ass Song was the film—a nightmare from the
				mind of Melvin Van Peebles.
				The initial screen image presented by the
				film of the “New Black Image," even before
				the film title was introduced, is a Black woman
				prostitute committing statutory rape on a 10-
				year-old Black child. And it is significant that
				the first image was created by a Black male.
				But lest we fall into our bourgeois or feminist
				trap of the simplistic notion of Black men
				against Black women, we must define what
				kind of man Van Peebles is—what is his class
				attitude? It was always defined by him in terms
			</p>
         <p>
				of money!!! To be sure, the brother was talent¬
				ed and witty. He even got across the racist
				Hollywood unions to make this flick, claiming
				he was giving Black people jobs, providing
				them with technical skills and film exposure.
				But how many of these non-union Black men
				and women were to reap a significant portion of
				the more than 312 million in profits? And what
				organizations did Van Peebles leave behind to
				intervene and counter the racism of the union?
				How women were depicted within the sup¬
				posedly “New Image'' was no more than a
				capitulation to sexist ideology. The screen no
				longer reflected the passive mammies, the
				tragic mulattos. They were now in the modern
				feminist idiom: the aggressive, gun-toting and
				in some cases emasculating "free fucking
				women,"' perpetuated by superstars Pam
				Greer, Vonetta McGee, and Pamela Dodson.
				They headed the money-making movies with
				their large breasts, long legs and pretty eyes
				rather than with their acting abilities. Or we
				saw the bit players whose primary acting tal¬
				ents lay in their ability to moan, groan and
				succumb to the ex-football machos like Jim
				Brown and Fred Williamson, or non-football
				heroes like Richard Roundtree. Again, these
				were men and women who were more commit¬
				ted to the mighty dollar—Hollywood—than to
			</p>
         <p>
				portraying a positive image to Black people.
				None of them had the social consciousness of
				our first Black film star Paul Robeson, whose
				portrayal of The Emperor Jones and a Black
				miner in the Welsh miners film called Proud
				Valley intimidated white film-makers. Paul
				Robéson was an ex-all-American football player
				who could also sing and act, even in the so¬
				called "legitimate theater " But he refused to
				be housenigger In his book Hear / Stand he
				said, "The artist must elect to fight for free¬
				dom or slavery. 1 have made my choice. Be¬
				tween 1942 and 1946 his income dropped from
				8100,000 to 56,000.
				There are some contemporary women who
				have refused to prostitute their talent. Cicely
				Tyson starved for years before she got the
				half-decent roles of Jane Pittman and the
				mother in “Roots." However both dramas had
				their shortcomings due to the commercialism of
				the productions. Read the book to determine
				how Kizzy and the other women might have
				been portrayed. In the book, for example.
				Kunta didn’t get caught because he stopped off
				to get a quicky, and it was he, not Belle, who
				fought to keep the slave buyer from taking his
				precious Kizzy. Note in the TV version that
				Belle's strength in fighting for Kizzy while
				Kunta fell crying to his knees was an excellent
				example of how the Black woman's image is
				manipulated to relegate the Black man to a de¬
				meaning, subservient position. Similarly in the
				show "Good Times,"' at one time TV's only
				complete and positive Black family, a strong
				John Amos was killed off, leaving Esther Rolle
				in a neo-mammy role, catering to the character
				played by Jimmy Walker In this case, the
				demise of the strong male image manipulates
				the strong woman into a less than positive
				image.
			</p>
         <p>
				The petit bourgeois will always level criticism
				at the progressive film-maker for presenting
				"Documentaries"' as opposed to “Art'' forms.
				This fragmented distinction between "art"' and
				reality"' is a superficial offspring of a bour¬
				geois capitalist society, reinforced by the artists/
				critics who see themselves separated and alien¬
				ated from the masses.
				Film-makers like Haille Gerima, Ousmane
				Sembene, Nana Mahomo, Chris Choy, Robert
				Van Lierop, and Jose Garcia will continue to
				have limited exposure. It is unfortunate that
				their creations will not reach the mass media
				and will never be the dominant theme of
				American film under the present economic
				system.
				The internationally acclaimed Cuban cinema
				could never have existed in the old days. It

				came only after the revolution. The award win¬
				ning film Lucia demonstrates the ability of
				film to portray women in a revolutionary his¬
				torical perspective. Its mass distribution is at¬
				tributed to the Cuban revolution. Only now, as
				in Bob Van Lierop's O Povo Organizado, do we
				see a revolutionary historical perspective of the
				African woman. Now Mozambique's artists are
				able to produce revolutionary images on a mass
				basis through the establishment of the National
				Cinema Institute.
			</p>
         <p>
				Black film-makers must now become prole¬
				tarianized—organizers, building the unions that
				Van Peebles failed to build, going beyond the
				boundaries of bourgeois nationalism and mak¬
				ing the necessary links with revolutionary film¬
				makers on an international basis. Most desir¬
				ably, when Black women themselves become
				involved in the film-making process there will
				be an appreciable change in portraying the true
				image of Black women in film, a portrayal
				which reflects our social reality.

				It ain't hot. It's hell out here.
				I was paying one hundred seventy-five dollars a year for that house, and it looked like it was about
				to fall. I was afeared the wind would blow it away. I had about twenty acres. I didn't make much, but I managed
				to get my children into college. Now I farm a little corn for the cows. I don't farm no cotton, cause there wasn't
				nothing toit.
				I have ten children, but they're only three left. All the rest done gone to Connecticut.
				It's been sad times. Jack and Bob and King are dead. They killed them, because they didn't want the
				Negroes brought out from under their foots. That's how come they killed them. I don't see nothing else.
