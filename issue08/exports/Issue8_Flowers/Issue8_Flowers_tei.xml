				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>For those of us
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>who were imprinted with fear
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>like a faint line in the center of our foreheads

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>World women are running smack into the brick
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>wall of legal institutional racism and sexism.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>We are being told, &quot;You do not qualify to do
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>the jobs you want to do. You do not meet the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>criteria for what is good enough.&quot; After the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>sixties and the women&apos;s movement, tokenism
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>and fair employment legislation, we are still
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>being squeezed out of making money, making
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>decisions and having control over our lives.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>White folks are still telling us that we don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>measure up.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>In high school during the forties, 1 was told
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>by my advisor that ! was a C student and would
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>always be, so 1 shouldn’t even bother to go to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>college. Coming from the big white lady who is
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>supposed to know about these things, on some
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>level, 1 believed her. There were no role
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>models, Black women or men or other Third
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>World people teaching there to make me think
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>otherwise. 1 was well into my thirties before
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>began to get out from under the impact of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>those words from the authorities: &quot;you&apos;re not
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>good enough.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>Well, 1 went to college twice. Once to under¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>graduate school for a B.A. and again to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>graduate school to become an occupational
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>therapist. No role models there to assuage my
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>doubts about any Black women being good
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>enough. And now 1 teach in college and often
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>think, &quot;See, Mrs. Murphy didn’t know what
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>she was talking about in 1947&quot;&apos;...until the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>issue of my tenure put me right back in touch
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>with the question of &quot;never quite being good
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>enough.&quot;
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>Today, legal institutional racism and sexism
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>continue to operate. Sometimes it is blatant, at
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>other times more subtle, but rarely do we hear
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>it publicly challenged these days. And if so, the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>old cries &quot;racist and sexist&quot;&apos; are usually dead
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>news by the next day. Discrimination in insti¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>tutions does not necessarily occur by conscious
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>intent or personal prejudice against a group.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>But racism, ethnic and language group dis¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>crimination, sexual prejudice and discrimination
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>as to gender and sexual orientation, and elitism
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>as to educational or economic class are a part
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>of every institution in America. Ageism and all
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>the other &quot;isms&quot;&apos; are practiced there too. We
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>are told to believe it has gone away.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>In most institutions, racism is fostered and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>nurtured by middle-aged white men who have
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>the inclination and the power to hire and retain
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>those persons who are exactly like themselves,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>i.e., &quot;middle-aged white men,&quot; and exclude all
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>others. This is especially true where critical de¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>cisions are made, and future directions and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>strategies are planned. You may be included if
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>you can prove that you can think and act exact¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>ly like a middle-aged white man. (Among Black
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>folks we call them “Oreo&quot;&apos; cookies—black on
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>the outside and white on the inside.)
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>Some women are a kind of “Oreo&quot; too. That
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>is, male-identified women. Women on the out¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>side and men on the inside where their value
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>system has incorporated all the sexist attitudes
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l32' n='N032'/>of men. These women may or may not look like
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l33' n='N033'/>men. They may or may not be lesbian women;
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l34' n='N034'/>more than likely they are not. The phenomenon
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l35' n='N035'/>of identification with the aggressor, or the op¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l2' n='N002'/>closeted&quot;&apos; homosexuals who are really homo¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>phobic, older persons who are on the top and

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>Many of these people make it to middle man¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>more ferociousness than the boss himself. We
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>frequently see through their appearance be¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>cause they feel like “the man.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>The message to us is always &quot;&apos;you&apos;re not
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>good enough&quot;&apos; and &quot;&apos;you don’t measure up to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>the job.&quot; But you can&apos;t measure up, because
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>who designed the very ruler by which you are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>being measured? Certainly it wasn’t no little
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>Black girls. White men have set all the criteria
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>for who and what is good enough. Women,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>African-Americans and other Third World peo¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>ple, the young, the elderly and the handi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>capped have had no input into those criteria
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>that measure them, and have had little, if any,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>chance to meet them. For have they had the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>very same opportunities that are offered by
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>money, skin color privilege, education, self¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>esteem, etc., that white men have had?
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>And if one happens to meet the criteria, that
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>is also no insurance for facts can be distorted,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>criteria ignored, behind the scene manipula¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>tions can occur and technicalities are often
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>raised; all done to ensure those with the power
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>protection from the &quot;others&quot;&apos; and to stamp the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>others&quot;&apos; as not quite good enough.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>So we don’t get to make the rulers. If so, we
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>might make it an 11-inch &quot;foot&quot;&apos; ruler or a 13-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>inch “foot&quot;&apos; ruler and middle-aged white men
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>might not fit. They might not meet the new
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>criteria. They might be short on or lacking in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>spirit or humility, be overconfident and/or poor
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>managers. Look around our world. What a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>mess they have made. Look at the output of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>middle-aged white men in charge of govern¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>ment, energy, health, inflation, etc., and one
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>can see they are certainly very short on prob¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>em-solving skills.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l45' n='N045'/>When you step back and take a good look at
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l46' n='N046'/>who is making money off of whom, these mid¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l47' n='N047'/>dle-aged white men and their agents look like
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l48' n='N048'/>pimps. In ever-increasing numbers, at least in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l49' n='N049'/>the urban areas, Third World people and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l50' n='N050'/>women are consuming the services of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l51' n='N051'/>health and education industries. One might say
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l52' n='N052'/>these men are pimping off us. This seems
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l53' n='N053'/>especially true in the so-called alternative
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l54' n='N054'/>institutions and programs that were created
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l55' n='N055'/>from the aftermath of the “revolution,&quot; &quot;riots,&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l56' n='N056'/>demands and court actions of the sixties. These
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l57' n='N057'/>same institutions quietly slipped back into
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l58' n='N058'/>subtle racist and sexist politics in the guise of a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l59' n='N059'/>need for financial and economic feasibility. And
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l60' n='N060'/>those who did make it into the inner sanctum
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l61' n='N061'/>go the way of “the last hired and the first
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l62' n='N062'/>fired.&apos;
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>Well, we must consider what to do about it.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>One thing, we must begin to get our focus
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>clear. We don’t have to feel bad when they say
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>we don’t fit. We are not incompetent and must
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>get beyond feeling like a &quot;fraud&quot;&apos; in their (our)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>work spaces or feeling guilty about our supposed
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>failures. Remember their attitudes say more
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>about them than they say about us. They are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>the ones with the problem.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>Well, what about the endless process of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>qualifying&quot;&apos; to meet their standards? Well, we
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>can keep on qualifying until we get sick of it.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>Getting the necessary credentials is costly and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>time-consuming and never a guarantee. But
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>while doing so, we ought to be careful that we
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>do not become male-identified or &quot;whitecized
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>as Sylvia Vitale says. Take measures to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>counteract that phenomenon. Take strong doses
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>of the antidote like Black and Third World
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>Studies, women&apos;s studies, and humanistic
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>studies so that you know who you are.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>We can set our own criteria and standards.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>When working alone and together we discover
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>our own values and our own styles and know
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>they are no less valid than those of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>European patriarchy. We can be proud of our
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>own when they feel “right.&quot; Yes we can get
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>angry with the man and tell ’bout himself.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>Rage is an appropriate and necessary reaction
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>to oppression which blocks our need for safety,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>mastery and self-actualization. It&apos;s about living
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>not just surviving. And laugh at him too, with
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>the silly business of covering up his inade¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>quacies with face-saving arrogance. And above
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>all don’t forget the revolution has just begun.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>Get ready to struggle, you do qualify for that.
