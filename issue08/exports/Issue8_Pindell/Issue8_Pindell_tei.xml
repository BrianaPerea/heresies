				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>February 1979
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>The following notes were prepared for publi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>cation after ! participated in a symposium on
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>art criticism organized by John Goodyear and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>held at Douglass College, Rutgers University
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>New Brunswick, New Jersey, April 20, 1978.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>The panelists were Joseph Kosuth, Rosalind
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>Krauss, Morse Peckham, Alan Coleman, Leon
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>Golub and Howardena Pindell, with Donald
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>Kuspit as moderator The following questions
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>were addressed to the panelists by Kuspit prior
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>to the symposium:
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>Is the critic a legitimator of values? The art¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>ist carries the burden of his/her own jus¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>tification, but what is the role of the critic in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>this? Is it possible to eliminate any hierarchical
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>relationship between artists and critics—to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>eliminate any residue of feeling that the one is
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>better than the other? The working relationship
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>between the artist and the critic: how does one
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>deal with the possible promotional value of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>criticism, both bad and good, favorable and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>unfavorable to the artist? Does criticism exist
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>as a thing in itself, can it exist as such, or does
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>it only function along with the works with
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>which it deals?
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>The effects of criticism on the art work are
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>rarely confronted. Somehow the examination of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>any activity in the art community, criticism be¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>ing only one, is taboo, &quot;tasteless and crude.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>decided to tackle the subject despite the antici¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>pated disapproval, motivated partly by some of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>my riper experiences in the art world (during
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>my exhibition at A.I.R. Gallery in 1973 a young
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>white male critic confided to me that he hesi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>tated to review my exhibition because he heard
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>that 1 was black—and told me how relieved he
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>was to find that the work was good). In spite of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>some experiences to the contrary, 1 recognize
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>that a few critics, and even a few dealers, those
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>who pioneer in showing work considered “dif-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>ficult&quot;&apos; by the &quot;art world,&quot;&apos; do attempt to be
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>open and fair and aware of their own motiva¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>tions. It is to the remainder that 1 direct the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>following.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>have decided to take a rather subjective ap¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l47' n='N047'/>proach to the questions presented. When 1 read
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>through the topics to be discussed, my first
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l49' n='N049'/>response was a feeling of negativity towards
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>criticism and the institution of art writing as it
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>is manifested in art periodicals, mass-produced
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>art books, and newspapers. From my vantage
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>point as an artist, 1 find that critics usually
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>view an artist’s work while it is on exhibition in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>a gallery and, occasionally, while it is on view
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>in a public institution. A number of critics do
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>not as a rule go to the studio independent of an
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>exhibition. More often than not the gallery
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>exhibition brings them forth, prodded by the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>dealer or the artist, or coaxed by financial
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>necessity...the need to earn money or “brown¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>ie points&quot;&apos; by having reviews or articles pub¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>lished. The critic is therefore viewing work
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>which has been preselected by the dealer. A
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>gallery is a business. Making money is its
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>primary objective. The critic is used by the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>dealer as a means of endorsing the &quot;product&apos;i
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>work of art), ripening it for sale. (If a repro¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>duction of a work appears in a review or an
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>article, it is often sold as a result of the en¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>dorsement.) Criticism is contaminated by the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>fact that it is used to market a “product. A
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>parallel in the non-art world can be seen in the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>subtle manipulations utilized by advertising to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>create a need for a particular product in order
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>to increase profits. The critic is therefore used
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>as a means of &quot;hyping&quot; an artist&apos;s work.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>A number of unconscious factors determine
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>what is marketable and what is not, who is
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>written about and who is not. These un¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l32' n='N032'/>conscious factors include learned attitudes re¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l33' n='N033'/>flecting the negative and positive fantasies and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l34' n='N034'/>taboos of a culture. In this culture work by
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l35' n='N035'/>white males is more marketable than work by
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l36' n='N036'/>non-white males or females. (Occasionally
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l37' n='N037'/>honorary status&quot;&apos; is given to a non-white if a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l38' n='N038'/>market is temporarily created for the work.)
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l39' n='N039'/>The needs of the buyer are based on class,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l40' n='N040'/>caste, fashion, and personal preference, guided
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l41' n='N041'/>by unconscious factors. The buyer will tend to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l42' n='N042'/>select that which appears to enhance self-image
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l43' n='N043'/>and improve status. The dealer is influenced by
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l44' n='N044'/>the needs of the buyer The critic is used to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l45' n='N045'/>blessing&quot; this interchange and making it appear
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l46' n='N046'/>on the surface to be something other than what
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l47' n='N047'/>it is... a form of barter with hidden incen¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>their own unconscious needs and goals for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>status or power, needs which seem to keep

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>avoiding controversy or controversial artists.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>A simplistic allegory about the system could
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>be set forth: Some critics are gourmets (others,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>gourmands) who prefer to eat at the best res¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>taurants (i.e., galleries). The maître d&apos; (i.e.,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>dealer) knows the critic by name. Flattered by
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>this recognition the critic accepts the menu
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>(gallery staple) which lists the special of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>day (current exhibition). The critic may praise
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>or damn the cooking but returns for more. The
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>critic rarely cooks at home (goes outside the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>established system to see work).

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>The &quot;mongrel&quot;&apos; hordes represent the taboos
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>and negative fantasies of the tribe. The “mon¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>lawed by the main clan. Honorary status in the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>main clan may be achieved through death or a

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l1' n='N001'/>One could see the art world and the critic&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l2' n='N002'/>place within that world through the following:
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l3' n='N003'/>The art world is a neolithic, loose association of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l4' n='N004'/>clans within a larger tribe. The clan chiefs are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l5' n='N005'/>the dealers. The critics are the bards who sing
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l6' n='N006'/>the praises of the clan and its leaders. Artists
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l7' n='N007'/>are the shamans whose talents are sold through
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l8' n='N008'/>the chief. Rituals, reinforcement of the tribal
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l9' n='N009'/>structure, are performed in huts or compounds
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l10' n='N010'/>designated for this purpose (private and public
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l11' n='N011'/>institutions, auction houses).
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l12' n='N012'/>Advancement within the clan to higher rank
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l13' n='N013'/>is predominantly achieved through strategies
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l14' n='N014'/>dependent on the buddy system and nepotism.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l15' n='N015'/>White males hold most of the prominent posi¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l6' n='N006'/>would be reviewed where the gender and race
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l7' n='N007'/>of the artist are known, and not known, as well
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l8' n='N008'/>as the artist&apos;s financial status (i.e., whether the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l9' n='N009'/>work sells or doesn’t sell). A fascinating study
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l10' n='N010'/>is discussed in Vance Packard&apos;s Hidden Per¬
