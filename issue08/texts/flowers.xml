				<p> As the curtain of economic scarcity drops over our daily lives, Black and other
					Third World women are running smack into the brick wall of legal institutional
					racism and sexism. We are being told, "You do not qualify to do the jobs you
					want to do. You do not meet the criteria for what is good enough." After the
					sixties and the women's movement, tokenism and fair employment legislation, we
					are still being squeezed out of making money, making decisions and having
					control over our lives. White folks are still telling us that we don't measure
					up.</p>
				<p>In high school during the forties, 1 was told by my advisor that ! was a C
					student and would always be, so 1 shouldn’t even bother to go to college. Coming
					from the big white lady who is supposed to know about these things, on some
					level, 1 believed her. There were no role models, Black women or men or other
					Third World people teaching there to make me think otherwise. 1 was well into my
					thirties before began to get out from under the impact of those words from the
					authorities: "you're not good enough."</p>
				<p>Well, 1 went to college twice. Once to undergraduate school for a B.A. and
					again to graduate school to become an occupational therapist. No role models
					there to assuage my doubts about any Black women being good enough. And now 1
					teach in college and often think, "See, Mrs. Murphy didn’t know what she was
					talking about in 1947"'...until the issue of my tenure put me right back in
					touch with the question of "never quite being good enough." </p>
				<p> Today, legal institutional racism and sexism continue to operate. Sometimes it
					is blatant, at other times more subtle, but rarely do we hear it publicly
					challenged these days. And if so, the old cries "racist and sexist"' are usually
					dead news by the next day. Discrimination in institutions does not necessarily
					occur by conscious intent or personal prejudice against a group. But racism,
					ethnic and language group discrimination, sexual prejudice and discrimination
					as to gender and sexual orientation, and elitism as to educational or economic
					class are a part of every institution in America. Ageism and all the other
					"isms"' are practiced there too. We are told to believe it has gone away.</p>
				<p>In most institutions, racism is fostered and nurtured by middle-aged white men
					who have the inclination and the power to hire and retain those persons who are
					exactly like themselves, i.e., "middle-aged white men," and exclude all others.
					This is especially true where critical decisions are made, and future
					directions and strategies are planned. You may be included if you can prove that
					you can think and act exactly like a middle-aged white man. (Among Black folks
					we call them “Oreo"' cookies—black on the outside and white on the inside.)</p>
				<p>Some women are a kind of “Oreo" too. That is, male-identified women. Women on the
					outside and men on the inside where their value system has incorporated all
					the sexist attitudes of men. These women may or may not look like men. They may
					or may not be lesbian women; more than likely they are not. The phenomenon of
					identification with the aggressor, or the oppressor as Paulo Frere defines it,
					does not end <pb n="32"/> there. We find it among all the "isms," closeted"'
					homosexuals who are really homophobic, older persons who are on the top and
					will not hire their peers or their seniors, etc. Many of these people make it to
					middle management positions, assisting the boss, overseers, keeping the
					“niggers"' in line with even more ferociousness than the boss himself. We
					frequently see through their appearance because they feel like “the man.</p>
				<p>The message to us is always "'you're not good enough"' and "'you don’t measure up
					to the job." But you can't measure up, because who designed the very ruler by
					which you are being measured? Certainly it wasn’t no little Black girls. White
					men have set all the criteria for who and what is good enough. Women,
					African-Americans and other Third World people, the young, the elderly and the
					handicapped have had no input into those criteria that measure them, and have
					had little, if any, chance to meet them. For have they had the very same
					opportunities that are offered by money, skin color privilege, education, self¬
					esteem, etc., that white men have had?</p>
				<p>And if one happens to meet the criteria, that is also no insurance for facts can
					be distorted, criteria ignored, behind the scene manipulations can occur and
					technicalities are often raised; all done to ensure those with the power
					protection from the "others"' and to stamp the others"' as not quite good
					enough.</p>
				<p>So we don’t get to make the rulers. If so, we might make it an 11-inch "foot"'
					ruler or a 13- inch “foot"' ruler and middle-aged white men might not fit. They
					might not meet the new criteria. They might be short on or lacking in spirit or
					humility, be overconfident and/or poor managers. Look around our world. What a
					mess they have made. Look at the output of middle-aged white men in charge of
					government, energy, health, inflation, etc., and one can see they are
					certainly very short on probem-solving skills.</p>
				<p>When you step back and take a good look at who is making money off of whom, these
					middle-aged white men and their agents look like pimps. In ever-increasing
					numbers, at least in the urban areas, Third World people and women are consuming
					the services of the health and education industries. One might say these men are
					pimping off us. This seems especially true in the so-called alternative
					institutions and programs that were created from the aftermath of the
					“revolution," "riots,' demands and court actions of the sixties. These same
					institutions quietly slipped back into subtle racist and sexist politics in the
					guise of a need for financial and economic feasibility. And those who did make
					it into the inner sanctum go the way of “the last hired and the first fired.' </p>
				<p> Well, we must consider what to do about it. One thing, we must begin to get our
					focus clear. We don’t have to feel bad when they say we don’t fit. We are not
					incompetent and must get beyond feeling like a "fraud"' in their (our) work
					spaces or feeling guilty about our supposed failures. Remember their attitudes
					say more about them than they say about us. They are the ones with the
					problem.</p>
				<p>Well, what about the endless process of qualifying"' to meet their standards?
					Well, we can keep on qualifying until we get sick of it. Getting the necessary
					credentials is costly and time-consuming and never a guarantee. But while doing
					so, we ought to be careful that we do not become male-identified or "whitecized
					as Sylvia Vitale says. Take measures to counteract that phenomenon. Take strong
					doses of the antidote like Black and Third World Studies, women's studies, and
					humanistic studies so that you know who you are.</p>
				<p>We can set our own criteria and standards. When working alone and together we
					discover our own values and our own styles and know they are no less valid than
					those of the European patriarchy. We can be proud of our own when they feel
					“right." Yes we can get angry with the man and tell ’bout himself. Rage is an
					appropriate and necessary reaction to oppression which blocks our need for
					safety, mastery and self-actualization. It's about living not just surviving.
					And laugh at him too, with the silly business of covering up his inadequacies
					with face-saving arrogance. And above all don’t forget the revolution has just
					begun. Get ready to struggle, you do qualify for that.</p>
