				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>With whom does history empathize? For
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>Walter Benjamin, “The answer is inevita¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>ble: with the victor.”1 The reciprocity be¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>tween historian and ruler is tacit: the his¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>torian makes official the ruler’s authority
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>and the ruler’s authority gives the histori¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>an’s work validity. This is not to suggest
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>that no histories exist that subvert this
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>premise. Literature is a “history” which in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>most cases serves the prevailing order
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>because its very existence confirms that
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>order’s cultural richness. But literature is
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>privileged because it can employ language’s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>nuance and allusiveness and from the inside
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>gently or joltingly criticize that order. Be-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>cause literature is by implication a cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>artifact of a ruling order, subversive or not,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>it is a historical spoil owing as much to the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>anonymous toil that gave the writer time to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>pursue an idea as to the original mind that
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>conceived it.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>The connection between a ruling order
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>and its cultural artifacts is like a strait sep¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>arating two bodies of water intimately link-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>ed in time and geography. The straits of lit¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>erature and history are evidenced in Jap¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>anese writing of the Heian period (794-1185
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>A.D.) which commands interest because of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>its richness of description, its pioneering of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>new forms, and the fact that its leading
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>practitioners were women. Many social and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>cultural conditions set the stage for this un¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>precedented predominance of literary
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>women. According to Ivan Morris,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>Though they (peasants, fishermen, forest-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>men and other laborers) contributed to the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>vast majority of the (Heian period’s) popula¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>tion and were the only economically pro¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>ductive class in the country, we virtually
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>have no authentic information about their
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>lives.”2 What we today know of Heian life
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>has been garnered from the literature of that
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>period—especially from Murasaki Shikibu’s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>The Tale of Genji and Sei Shonagon’s The
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>Pillow Book—but these literary milestones
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>detailing Heian court life treat a population
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l47' n='N047'/>of only about one-tenth of one percent of the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>five million population in Japan at that
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l49' n='N049'/>time.3
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l50' n='N050'/>Murasaki’s and Sei’s originality of form
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l51' n='N051'/>and observation is unparalleled in the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l52' n='N052'/>history of literature. These two women were

				<lb facs='#facs_1_line_1670955793833_565' n='N002'/>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l2' n='N003'/>contemporaries; both were brought to court
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l3' n='N004'/>from the provinces because of their talent
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l4' n='N005'/>and intelligence. Due to the complications
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l5' n='N006'/>of Japan’s clan politics, there was a “court&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l6' n='N007'/>with many satellite courts, and it is not
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l7' n='N008'/>known whether these two women ever lived
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l8' n='N009'/>in the same palace, although they were
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l9' n='N010'/>aware of each other’s writings. Their social
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l10' n='N011'/>position was substantially different from
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l11' n='N012'/>that of the women outside the court who
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l12' n='N013'/>“toiled arduously, were subject to harsh
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l13' n='N014'/>treatment by their men, bred young, and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l14' n='N015'/>died early.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l15' n='N016'/>Murasaki and Sei are figures of incalcu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l16' n='N017'/>lable significance because they were pio¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l17' n='N018'/>neers, because they produced work in a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l18' n='N019'/>period which had articulated for itself a dis¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l19' n='N020'/>tinct masculine and feminine aesthetic, and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l20' n='N021'/>because they wrote in Japanese at a time
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l21' n='N022'/>when the language for official and theologi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l22' n='N023'/>cal affairs was Chinese (cf. the European
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l23' n='N024'/>use of Latin as an “official” language). Not
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l24' n='N025'/>only did they establish traditions of the psy¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l25' n='N026'/>chological novel and the diary, but their
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l26' n='N027'/>writings preserved the Japanese language
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l27' n='N028'/>for subsequent generations. In their day
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l28' n='N029'/>women were restricted to the use of Japan¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l29' n='N030'/>ese while men exchanged ideas and conver¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l30' n='N031'/>sation in Chinese. Even today the dis¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l31' n='N032'/>tinction between native syllabary and the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l32' n='N033'/>Chinese characters incorporated into the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l33' n='N034'/>language reflects this gender dichotomy.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l34' n='N035'/>The native characters are called onnade, or
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l35' n='N036'/>woman’s hand,” while Chinese characters
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l36' n='N037'/>are known as otokomoji, “man’s letters.”
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l37' n='N038'/>Sei’s writings are still studied today for the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l38' n='N039'/>purity of her Japanese diction; she avoided
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l39' n='N040'/>Chinese-isms—an accomplishment compar¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l40' n='N041'/>able to writing in English without using any
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l41' n='N042'/>Latinate words.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l42' n='N043'/>In the time of Murasaki and Sei there
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l43' n='N044'/>were no narrative literary traditions to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l44' n='N045'/>maintain. Japanese literature before their
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l45' n='N046'/>time had been poetry of a calculatedly
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l46' n='N047'/>oblique nature; a long prologomena was
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l47' n='N048'/>necessary to explain the poem’s meaning.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l48' n='N049'/>What a remarkable achievement to conceive
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l49' n='N050'/>a psychological novel—as Murasaki did—
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l50' n='N051'/>where a poem appears as an organic expres¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l51' n='N052'/>sion within the context of a narrative and re¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l52' n='N053'/>quires no annotation to be understood.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l53' n='N054'/>Murasaki fused the traditional poetic form
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l1' n='N001'/>with her narrative innovation, the intimate
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l2' n='N002'/>epic. Sei’s Pillow Book was so called
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l3' n='N003'/>because she suggested to the empress that
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l4' n='N004'/>notebooks of historical documents could be
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l5' n='N005'/>recycled by making them into a pillow (a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l6' n='N006'/>word that referred to a diary as well as a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l7' n='N007'/>head rest); Sei filled her notebook with lists,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l8' n='N008'/>odd facts and observations from the present,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l9' n='N009'/>thereby annotating the leaves of official
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l10' n='N010'/>history with her lively opinions.“ For both
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l11' n='N011'/>these women, objectivity was the domain of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l12' n='N012'/>the historian and untenable because it neu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l13' n='N013'/>tralized differing positions. Objects and peo¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l14' n='N014'/>ple, in the writings of Murasaki and Sei,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l15' n='N015'/>have innumerable facets. They intimated
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l16' n='N016'/>the spirit of an object or a person by bom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l17' n='N017'/>barding the reader with dense description:
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l18' n='N018'/>lists, textures, physical and natural detail.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l19' n='N019'/>Collectively their historical truth is compel¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l20' n='N020'/>ling because they replace “objectivity” with
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l21' n='N021'/>opinionation.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l22' n='N022'/>But these two contemporaries reflected
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l23' n='N023'/>different attitudes about their culture. Sei
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l24' n='N024'/>begins a chapter of her book with: “When I
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l25' n='N025'/>make myself imagine what it is like to be one
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l26' n='N026'/>of those women who live at home, faithfully
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l27' n='N027'/>serving their husbands—women who have
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l28' n='N028'/>not a single exciting prospect in life yet be¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l29' n='N029'/>lieve they are perfectly happy—I am filled
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l30' n='N030'/>with scorn.”” In a passage where Murasaki
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l31' n='N031'/>describes Genji’s (and by implication her
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l32' n='N032'/>own) view of the novel, Genji observes,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l33' n='N033'/>“Without it what should we know of how
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l34' n='N034'/>people lived in the past from the age of the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l35' n='N035'/>Gods down to the present day? For history
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l36' n='N036'/>books . . . show us only one corner of life;
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l37' n='N037'/>whereas these diaries and romances which I
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l38' n='N038'/>see piled around you contain, 1 am sure, the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l39' n='N039'/>most minute information about people&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l40' n='N040'/>private affairs.”° Sei and Murasaki charted
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l41' n='N041'/>divergent routes in their writing: Sei was an
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l42' n='N042'/>empiricist recording impressions of contem¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l43' n='N043'/>porary Heian manners; she lacked the self¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l44' n='N044'/>consciousness of Murasaki, who fashioned a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l45' n='N045'/>world in the indeterminate past in order to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l46' n='N046'/>best intuitively comment on life in her im¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l47' n='N047'/>mediate present. Sei’s literary concerns were
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l48' n='N048'/>the refined tastes of the nobility and the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l49' n='N049'/>freshness of nature. Murasaki was less im¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l50' n='N050'/>pressionistic and more analytic in her eval¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l51' n='N051'/>uation of Heian society. She continuously
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l52' n='N052'/>tells us that it was best to be born a man of
			</p>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l1' n='N001'/>imperial blood and live at the court. But she
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l2' n='N002'/>was keenly aware of the hierarchies within
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>the aristocracy and observed the tension
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>between provincials and the court clique, as
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>well as sensitively articulating the social
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l6' n='N006'/>restrictions limiting the mobility of the lower
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l7' n='N007'/>ranks within the court.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>A number of factors informed the atti¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>tudes Sei and Murasaki expressed. The
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>birth of a woman was a happy event because
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>in the marriage politics of Heian society e
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>woman might grow up to marry the emper-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>or. It was much easier in their day for a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>woman of &quot;inferior” birth to marry a man of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>noble rank than vice versa. The professions
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>which brought a lower-rank man to the cap-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>ital—scholar or priest, say—would not auto¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>matically give him ingress to the imperial
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>circle, while it seems likely that Sei and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>Murasaki were brought to the court because
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>of their reputations as women of wit and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>sensibility. In Heian Japan a woman was
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>allowed both to inherit and own property.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>The civil codes expressly forbade wife-beat¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>ing, although the punishment for this was
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>two degrees less than assaulting “other
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>people.”° But these facts don’t pinpoint the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>complex and inbred quality of Heian life,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>which is best described by the Chinese prov¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>erb: “The people are as far from the Emper¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>or as from heaven. Japanese appropriation
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>of China’s governmental centralization pro¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>duced a bureaucracy so awkward in this
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>land of decentralized clans that the delega¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>tion of authority was carried to extreme
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>lengths; the source of authority was, accord¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>ingly, far removed from the functionary who
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>directly wielded it. Because the real power
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>was exercised by ministers and other imperi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>al subalterns, the emperor was left with two
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>functions: to encourage new art forms and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>fashion rituals of piety from the religious hy¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>brid of Shinto and Buddhist beliefs. Women
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>were excluded from public affairs, but they
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l45' n='N045'/>played a tremendous role in the Heian
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l46' n='N046'/>court. A well-born woman had leisure and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l47' n='N047'/>imperial encouragement for creation and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l48' n='N048'/>contemplation denied to male counterparts
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l49' n='N049'/>busy with official duties and polygamous
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l50' n='N050'/>pursuits (the man at the Heian court was ex¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l51' n='N051'/>pected to have a wife and a few mistresses).

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>Heian period, aristocratic women enjoyed a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>multiplicity of partners as well. Later ages
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>would revile Sei and Murasaki for their
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>“foully licentious””1° descriptions, but prom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>iscuity was a vital element of their culture
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>The largely endogamous Heian court was
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>energized by the covert alliances of pro¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>vincials with sovereigns and their
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>subalterns. The ruling clan of the Heian
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>period—the Fujiwaras—never commanded
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>significant military strength but established
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>power by marrying their daughters to sover¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>eigns. The famous Fujiwara Michinaga was
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>father-in-law of two emperors, grandfather
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>of a third, grandfather and greatgrandfather
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>of a fourth, grandfather and father-in-law of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>a fifth.&quot; This kind of inbreeding was the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>substructure of the court clique. The
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>nominal source of power, this clique was at¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>tractive because it nurtured the creation of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>art. But it needed the vitality of provincials
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>like Sei and Murasaki to regenerate its in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>cestuous ranks.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>Once at court, Sei and Murasaki became
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>insiders who made observations on the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>social arts at a time when manners were
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>politics and politics culture. Murasaki wrote
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>of a picture competition designed by Genji
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>to rechannel court enmities to less des¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>tructive ends: “It was indeed a moment in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>the history of our country when the whole
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>energy of the nation seemed to be concen¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>trated upon the search for the prettiest
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>method of mounting paper scrolls.”12
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>Murasaki’s and Sei’s importance is that
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>while they operated in a culture that re¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>garded women as inferior to men, they never
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>believed that of themselves. Although in her
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>diary Murasaki repeatedly alluded to her
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>father’s regret that because of her great in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>telligence she had not been born male, she
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>characterized the richness of both male and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>female experiences in Genji. Although it is
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l46' n='N046'/>clear in Genji that men have more options
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l47' n='N047'/>available to them, women are equal in wit,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l48' n='N048'/>intelligence and style. Sei, perhaps because
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l49' n='N049'/>of her position as the empress favorite, is
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l50' n='N050'/>much more interested in the doings of im¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>power-identified at a time when power was
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>not so much a link with male dominance as
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>it was one expression in a complex social
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>milieu in which women participated. Mura¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>saki and Sei dealt with emotions that are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>universally intelligible and exist cross¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>culturally—unlike the objective specificities
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>of the official histories and philosophies in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>which the men of their day engaged. Edu-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>cated women were able to act and write less
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>conventionally than were men of com¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>parable status.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>Could a Heian man have created work
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>like Murasaki and Sei? The self-conscious
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>Heian court was totally aware of the sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>division of speech and the exclusion of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>women from the public sphere. Only at
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>court could women “circulate” and not be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>expected to hide behind fans and screens,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>the way propriety demanded women do out-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>side the court. The “masculine” style,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>identified by scholars of Japanese literature
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>as well as by Murasaki and Sei in various
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>appreciations of male qualities, was “the di¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>rectness of utterance and concern with
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>society.”1 The “feminine” preference was
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>taken to be the interest in suggestion and in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>tuition—which was the style imitated by
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>men when they wrote to women or expressed
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>themselves in affairs of the heart. A man
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>could have written in the style of Murasaki
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>and Sei, and, indeed, some men assumed
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>the feminine voice and pretended to be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>women authors. But the incisiveness and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>sensibility of these female impersonators is
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>inferior to the work of Murasaki and Sei.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>The inference that women sensed nuance in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>affairs of state while men were consigned
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>blindly to conduct these affairs leads to a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>simplistic “women feel/men think” conclu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>sion that fails to cut through psychology or
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>historicism. Men couldn’t create work like
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>Murasaki and Sei, even though they tried.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>These women were successful in capturing
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>the range of experience and feeling of both
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l47' n='N047'/>sexes.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>Why were they successful? They glorified
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l49' n='N049'/>a shining nobility. They catalogued and or¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l50' n='N050'/>dered a courtly etiquette rich in gestural nu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l51' n='N051'/>ance, which inspired contemporary court

			<pb n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l1' n='N001'/>behavior. They articulated a feminine posi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l2' n='N002'/>tion to which men could respond. Both pro¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>vincials, they described a life outside the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>court that seemed raw and exotic to the in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>bred Heian court. Murasaki characterized
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l6' n='N006'/>the province/capital dichotomy when she
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l7' n='N007'/>wrote about Genji’s scrolls made during his
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>exile on the Suma coast: Amid intense ex¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>citement . . . (they) produced a roll con¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>taining Genji’s sketches at Suma . . . so
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>masterly a hand working at complete leisure
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>and far from the distracting influences
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>which beset an artist in town. They saw so
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>vividly presented both the stem manner of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>his life there and in some sort the feelings
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>which this rustic life had aroused in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>everyone used to every luxury and in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>dulgence.”1 Soon after The Tale of Genji
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>appeared at court, Genji was adopted as a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>Shinto deity.15
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>Sei’s open competition with men—even
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>with those of a higher rank—gave the Heian
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>court a model of an openly combative
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>woman who refused to acquiesce to the pre¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>vailing notions of female propriety. She
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>writes with glee how she embarrassed the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>minister Nobutsune (who was Murasaki’s
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>cousin): “One day when Nobutsune was
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>serving as Intendant in the Office of Palace
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>Works he sent a sketch to one of the crafts¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>men explaining how a certain piece of work
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>should be done. Kindly execute in this
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>fashion,’ he added in Chinese characters. I
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>happened to notice the piece of paper and it
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>was the most preposterous writing 1 had
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>ever seen. Next to his message 1 wrote, ’If
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>you do the work in this style, it will certainly
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>turn out strangely.” The document found its

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>one who saw it was greatly amused—except,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>of course, Nobutsune, who was furious and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>after this held a grudge against me.”16
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>Murasaki acidly noted in her diary, “Some-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>one [Sei who makes such an effort to be dif-

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l47' n='N047'/>future will be a hard one. She is a gifted
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l48' n='N048'/>woman, to be sure . . . how can things turn
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l49' n='N049'/>out well for such a woman?”17
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l50' n='N050'/>Sei and Murasaki challenged the religious

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>such literary power and evocativeness.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>History regards Heian Japan as a golden
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>age whose achievements rank with those of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>Byzantium, Athens, and Renaissance Italy.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>l’he work of these two women recorded that
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>period with greater depth and insight than
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>any other contemporary cultural products,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>so much so that virtually all that is known
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>about the period has been learned from their
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>writings.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>Two questions remain: What is the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>deeper meaning of a golden age”? What
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>was Murasaki’s and Sei’s relationship to the

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>strength and together give the impression of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>an ideal social harmony. Cultural achieve¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>the case, by a few at the expense of many.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>Like two facing mirrors, the literature re¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>double edge to each. Murasaki’s choice to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>place her tale in the indeterminate past sug¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>gests two contradictory readings: Did the

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>there is throughout Murasaki’s novel a wist-

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>sion has a hopeless tone. Sei’s devotion to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>the imperial family and her contempt for the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>lower orders (an attitude that prompted a

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l48' n='N048'/>Heian court was good breeding but for the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l49' n='N049'/>modern reader is patronizing and blind.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l50' n='N050'/>Sei’s circumscribed vision and partisanship
