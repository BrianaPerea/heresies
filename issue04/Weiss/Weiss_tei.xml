				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l1' n='N001'/>Adelaide Alsop Robineau (1865-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l2' n='N002'/>1929) who worked and lived most of her
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>life in Syracuse, New York, was one of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>the foremost ceramists of her time and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>is today regarded by many as America’s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l6' n='N006'/>greatest ceramist. She was a perfec¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l7' n='N007'/>tionist: in 25 years of continued cre¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>ativity she produced only 600 works
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>which she deemed worthy of survival.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>Nearly every known piece is a superior
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>example of its type, whether it be the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>grand feu (high-fire) porcelain at which
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>she excelled or stoneware; crystalline
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>glaze or flammé; excised or pierced egg¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>shell.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>Born in Middletown, Connecticut,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>the daughter of an engineer and invent-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>or, Adelaide Alsop was artistically tal¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>ented and determined to be self¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>supporting. She first turned to the dec¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>oration of porcelain, teaching herself
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>the technique from books. She was
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>soon proficient enough to become a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>teacher of porcelain painting, a career
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>she pursued for several years at St.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>Mary s Hall school in Minnesota. In
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>the early 1890s she returned to New
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>York where she studied painting briefly
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>with William Merritt Chase, still sup¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>porting herself as a china decorator.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>At 34, she married Samuel Robineau
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>whom she had met in the Midwest.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>They joined G. H. Clark in Syracuse to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>found and publish Keramic Studio with
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>Adelaide Robineau as editor. The new
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>porcelain painters’ magazine soon dom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>mated the field. A typical issue might
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>include descriptions of new materials
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>and techniques, an art historical article
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>on Chinese porcelain painting and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>Robineau’s own designs and writings.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>Keramic Studio complemented another
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>nationally known magazine published
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>in the Syracuse area, The Craftsman.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l45' n='N045'/>Edited by Gustave Stickley, creator of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l46' n='N046'/>Mission furniture, it promoted the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l47' n='N047'/>ideals of the international arts and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l48' n='N048'/>crafts movement inherited from Wil¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l49' n='N049'/>liam Morris. The magazines were ex¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l50' n='N050'/>tremely influential to the development
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l51' n='N051'/>and flourishing of the American arts
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_1_1l52' n='N052'/>and crafts movement, achieving na¬

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l4' n='N004'/>longed to create new forms and inspired
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l5' n='N005'/>by these articles she went to study with
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l6' n='N006'/>Charles Binns at the pottery school in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l7' n='N007'/>Alfred, New York. She then set up her
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l8' n='N008'/>own kiln at home and fired her first
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l9' n='N009'/>batch of porcelains, with her husband
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l10' n='N010'/>serving as her advisor and technician.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l11' n='N011'/>She experimented alone, however, with
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l12' n='N012'/>different clay bodies and developed a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l13' n='N013'/>remarkable range of glazes, fixed and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l14' n='N014'/>flowing, crystalline and matte, for
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l15' n='N015'/>which she is famous.3 She also ex¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l16' n='N016'/>perimented endlessly to adjust Doats
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l17' n='N017'/>formulas to her own materials and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l18' n='N018'/>discovered a special variety of Texas
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l19' n='N019'/>kaolin that lent itself to her re¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l20' n='N020'/>quirements of translucency and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l21' n='N021'/>strength.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l22' n='N022'/>In 1903-1904, the Robineaus built a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l23' n='N023'/>house and separate studio on a hillside
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l24' n='N024'/>overlooking Syracuse which Adelaide
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l25' n='N025'/>designed with an architect friend
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l26' n='N026'/>Catharine Budd. The studio building
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l27' n='N027'/>consisted of three stories: the kiln area
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l28' n='N028'/>on the first floor, the pottery on the se¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l29' n='N029'/>cond and a playroom for the three
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l30' n='N030'/>Robineau children on the third. Having
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l31' n='N031'/>the children nearby while mother pur¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l32' n='N032'/>sued her profession was considered
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l33' n='N033'/>drastically “modern” when the Rob-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l34' n='N034'/>ineau home was featured in American
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l35' n='N035'/>Homes and Gardens in 1910.* The
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l36' n='N036'/>buildings still stand on Robineau Road
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l37' n='N037'/>in Syracuse.

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l1' n='N001'/>Adelaide Robineau’s brilliant experi-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l2' n='N002'/>ments included the oxblood flammé of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l3' n='N003'/>Chinese tradition, crystalline glazes in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l4' n='N004'/>blue, white and maize, crackles and in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l5' n='N005'/>laid slip designs. She undertook a chal¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l6' n='N006'/>lenge most of her contemporaries
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l7' n='N007'/>thought was impossible: the creation of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l8' n='N008'/>eggshell coupes or shallow rimless
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l9' n='N009'/>bowls with excised designs. Because the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l10' n='N010'/>paper-thin porcelain clay is so brittle, it
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l11' n='N011'/>can only be worked in the dry state,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l12' n='N012'/>and carving it requires extraordinary
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l13' n='N013'/>patience and delicacy. Of her 12 at-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l14' n='N014'/>tempts at eggshell pieces, only three
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l15' n='N015'/>survived. The third, with a beautiful.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l16' n='N016'/>excised design of swans, was broken
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l17' n='N017'/>in Detroit on its way to an exhibition.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l18' n='N018'/>In 1910 Robineau was invited by Ed¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l19' n='N019'/>ward G. Lewis, founder of the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l20' n='N020'/>American Women s League, to teach af
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l21' n='N021'/>University City Pottery at St. Louis,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l22' n='N022'/>Missouri, and to work there with Tax¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l23' n='N023'/>ile Doat. According to Paul Evans,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l24' n='N024'/>for a short time the University City
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l25' n='N025'/>Pottery had the most notable group of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l26' n='N026'/>ceramic artists and experts thus far
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l27' n='N027'/>associated with an institution in this
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l28' n='N028'/>country.”5 While there the Robineaus
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l29' n='N029'/>founded another magazine, Palette and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l30' n='N030'/>Bench, under Lewis s sponsorship.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l31' n='N031'/>It was also in St. Louis that Robin¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l32' n='N032'/>eau created the magnificent “Scarab
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l33' n='N033'/>Vase” which won a grand prize at the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l34' n='N034'/>1910 Turin International Exposition. It
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l35' n='N035'/>required 1,000 hours of labor and two
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l36' n='N036'/>firings. Also called “The Apotheosis of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l37' n='N037'/>the Toiler, the vase is decorated with
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l38' n='N038'/>an excised design of scarabs, a symbolic
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l39' n='N039'/>reference to the patience and skill
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l40' n='N040'/>demanded of the craftswoman. It is of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l41' n='N041'/>translucent porcelain with an unglazed
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l42' n='N042'/>background and a relief design in a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l43' n='N043'/>semi-opaque white glaze. Accents in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l44' n='N044'/>pale blue-green are achieved with a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l45' n='N045'/>thin, fixed, semi-opaque copper glaze.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l46' n='N046'/>In the “Poppy Vase of 1910, Robin-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l47' n='N047'/>eau expressed a personal style that the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l48' n='N048'/>influential New York critic, Royal Cor-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l49' n='N049'/>tissoz, later called “a blending of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l50' n='N050'/>precious qualities—of knowledge, skill,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l51' n='N051'/>judgement, taste, and above all, the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l52' n='N052'/>sense of beauty.”7 This vase, 6¼ inches
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l53' n='N053'/>high, is decorated with an exquisite
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l54' n='N054'/>poppy and leaf design which was first
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l55' n='N055'/>excised and then inlaid with colored
			</p>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>slips. In the firing, the glazes remained
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>perfectly set within the inlay, coloring
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>and hardening to produce the effect of a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>transparent enamel over the whole.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>Small as it is, the vase has a monu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>mental quality typical of Robineau s
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>best work.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>Another masterpiece is the “Viking
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>Ship Vase” of 1905. With rich matte
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>and semi-matte glazes of blue, green,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>brown and cream, the modest form is
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>decorated with a typical Art Nouveau
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>Viking ship motif, wave-tossed around
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>its rim, a symbol of human trans¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>cendence over the vicissitudes of life. In
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>a remarkable tour de force, the Viking
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>ship motif is transformed from relief to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>sculpture in the delicately pierced, in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>dependent stand which supports the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>vase.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>Vase after vase displays exquisite in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>vention, from the subtle striations of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>the “Snake Bowl” with its delicate rep-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>tilian head, to the iridescent crystals of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>a small untitled white vase. Stylistical¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>ly, the work ranges from restrained and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>elegant adaptations of Art Nouveau or
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>arts and crafts movement taste to the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>orientalizing manner of the eggshell
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>coupes to Art Deco urns.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>Her work was so specialized and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l32' n='N032'/>technically difficult that Robineau
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l33' n='N033'/>could not expect great monetary
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l34' n='N034'/>rewards. Whereas Louis Comfort Tif-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l35' n='N035'/>fany in New York and Lalique in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l36' n='N036'/>France employed many workers and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l37' n='N037'/>turned out multiple versions of their
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l38' n='N038'/>patterns, Robineau’s creations were
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l39' n='N039'/>unique. Once in an attempt to increase
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l40' n='N040'/>her income, she tried to mass-produce
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l41' n='N041'/>porcelain doorknobs, but the endless
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l42' n='N042'/>repetition so frustrated and bored hei
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l43' n='N043'/>that the operation ceased almost as
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l44' n='N044'/>soon as it began.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l45' n='N045'/>Nevertheless, she was richly reward
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l46' n='N046'/>ed by professional recognition during
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l47' n='N047'/>her lifetime. Her work was introduced
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l48' n='N048'/>to the public at the 1904 St. Louis Ex¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l49' n='N049'/>position and in 1905 Tiffany and Co.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l50' n='N050'/>became an agent for the Robineau por¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l51' n='N051'/>celains. She was selected to exhibit at
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l52' n='N052'/>the Musee des Arts Décoratifs and at
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l53' n='N053'/>the Paris Salon in 1911, was awarded
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l54' n='N054'/>Grand Prize at the 1915 San Francisco
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l55' n='N055'/>Exposition, and received special prizes
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l56' n='N056'/>and awards from the Art Institute of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l57' n='N057'/>Chicago and the societies of arts and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l58' n='N058'/>crafts in Detroit and Boston. She re¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l59' n='N059'/>ceived an honorary Doctor of Ceramic
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l60' n='N060'/>Science degree from Syracuse Universi-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l61' n='N061'/>ty in 1917 and in 1920 she joined the

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l35' n='N035'/>In this way Syracuse will have such a

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l55' n='N055'/>in an article she wrote for The Art

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l57' n='N057'/>This fascinating work unfortunately is
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l58' n='N058'/>not a paying proposition, but it has
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l59' n='N059'/>given me the satisfaction of doing orig
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l60' n='N060'/>inal work, work which has not been
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l61' n='N061'/>done in this country before and may not
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l62' n='N062'/>be done again. . . . I often dream of all
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l63' n='N063'/>the things I would have done if I had
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l64' n='N064'/>begun earlier in life or if I had been fi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l65' n='N065'/>nancially independent so that I could
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l66' n='N066'/>have devoted myself entirely to my por¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l67' n='N067'/>celains. The pieces I have produced are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l68' n='N068'/>few in number, but they represent in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l69' n='N069'/>design and shape the best that was in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l70' n='N070'/>me and I hope that some of them may
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l71' n='N071'/>be an inspiration to some artist of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l72' n='N072'/>future, who perhaps will be able to do
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l73' n='N073'/>more and better work than 1 have
