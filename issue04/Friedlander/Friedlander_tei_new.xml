				THE AESTHETICS OF OPPRESSION
			</p>
         <p>
				Traditional Arts
				of Women in
				Mexico
			</p>
         <p>
				Judith Friedlander

         <p>
				What do we mean by the traditional
				arts of women? All too often we are
				talking about activities that are not
				considered art either by the women who
				perform the tasks or by the societies in
				which they live. Some peoples do not
				conceptualize transforming mere cul¬
				tural’ activities into the domain of art.
				When the category does exist, women
				rarely emerge as the great artists. Com¬
				ing from a society where art is recog¬
				nized, valued and produced almost en¬
				tirely by men, it is not surprising that
			</p>
         <p>
				American feminists are interested in
				looking at the relationship women have
				to art in other cultures, to see if the
				comparison sheds additional light on
				the American condition. Before enter¬
				ing into such a discussion with material
				from Mexico, however, we should pro¬
				vide a more specific context for the
				cross-cultural analysis by reviewing
				some issues concerning art in the
				United States.
				Our society has a hierarchical view of
				art, making rigorous distinctions be¬
			</p>
         <pb n="2"/>
         <p>
				tween the so-called fine arts and the
				traditional or folk. The nature of fine
				arts is individualistic, that of the folk,
				collective. The fine arts represent the
				work of specialists, recognized person¬
				alities who dedicate themselves almost
				exclusively to their art. Even when they
				supplement their incomes with addi¬
				tional jobs, the culture sees them as art¬
				ists first. The folk arts, on the contrary,
				are the work of nonspecialists,
				unknown people who are, perhaps,
				farmers, fishermen, miners, individuals
				who make modest livings in “old-fash-
				ioned” ways and happen to produce
				folk art on the side. What is more, ac¬
				cording to cultural definitions, folk art¬
				ists do not create so much as carry on
				timeless traditions. They are living
				vestiges of the past and the more ob¬
				scure they are, the more authentic they
				appear.
				In a culture where progress, special¬
				ization and rugged individualism are
				valued, why have we created and main-
				tained such a static category as the tra¬
				ditional arts? We could argue that the
				anonymity and timelessness imposed
				on folk art permit those who practice
				the fine arts to borrow freely from tra¬
				ditional motifs. Who would accuse a
				Bartók of plagiarism just because he
				used Hungarian peasant melodies?
				Less cynically, but troubling all the
				same, we might suggest that the alien¬
				ation of our lives in modern America
				has awakened in many a yearning for
				simpler times and forms. Yet in order
				to have the “folk, a group of people
				must preserve for us the ways of the
				past—in the hills of Appalachia, in the
				African bush or in mud huts in Mexico.
				Feminists today are well acquainted
				with the cultural strategy that keeps
				folk artists in the obscurity of their
				grass-roots authenticity, for women
				have been erased in similar ways. Like
				the folk artist, woman is by definition a
				nonspecialist and a carrier of tradi¬
				tions. She is first and foremost a wife¬
				mother whose social and economic
				duties prevent her from having the time
				to specialize. Then, even if class
				privilege gives her the option to refuse
				her sex’s destiny, she still has to fight
				the culture’s traditional view that her
				creative powers are limited by her
				biology.
				Our culture has so successfully con¬
				fined the arts to the male sphere that it
				has developed sex-specific vocabularies
				to distinguish work done by men (spe¬
				cialized) from that done by women
				generalized). Thus, although tasks tra-
				ditionally assigned to women usually
				fall outside the arts entirely, a number
				of skills become lesser arts when per¬
			</p>
         <p>
				formed by male specialists. Women, for
				example, do sewing and cooking. Men
				are couturiérs or chefs. Careful to mark
				the status relationships, we borrow
				terms from the lofty French to describe
				the specialized work of a man, leaving
				the lower-class Anglo-Saxon to identify
				the chores that fragment a woman’s
				day. Of course there are female coutur¬
				ieres and chefs, and the numbers are
				undoubtedly growing as women today
				succeed in becoming professionals in
				these and other fields. Yet recent
				changes do not negate the long cultural
				history of the sexes in American society
				in which men (at least of certain
				classes) have been encouraged to spe¬
				cialize, while women (despite their
				class) have almost always been less rig¬
				orously trained, at best educated to
				dabble in a few areas, but by and large
				inadequately prepared for anything
				other than, perhaps, wifing and
				mothering.
				While feminist artists continue their
				struggle to change cultural definitions
				and thereby gain entry into the male¬
				dominated world of the fine arts, some
				are also trying to open the Academy to
				work usually associated with the “in¬
				ferior” crafts or simply with the domain
				of women s work. In the process, they
				have been collecting the nearly forgot-
				ten traditions of women in rural Amer¬
				ica and abroad, creating a specifically
				female folk culture by bringing to light
				previously unrecognized skills of
				unknown women who never had the
				chance to specialize. Given feminist
				consciousness, we can hope that those
				who produce the recently recognized
				art will emerge from obscurity as indi¬
				viduals, instead of being reduced to the
				collective anonymity so characteristic¬
				ally the fate of traditional artists. Still,
				lingering questions must be raised, for
				it is not entirely clear that we see what
				our interest in folk art may mean for
				those women who happen to be carry-
				ing on our timeless, authentic female
				culture.
				Other political movements have her¬
				alded the art of the folk while fighting
				to end their oppression—i.e., the Nar¬
				odniks in czarist Russia, intellectuals in
				the Mexican and Irish revolutions,
				leaders of Black and Native American
				Power movements—and it might be
				useful to analyze their histories careful¬
				ly. As a start, let us look at postrevo-
				lutionary Mexico, where we shall see
				how the enthusiasm expressed by urban
				oolitical leaders for traditional culture
				has been a mixed blessing, particularly
				for those who have been living the im¬
				poverished reality which seems to pre¬
				serve folk art the best. Specifically we
			</p>
         <p>
				shall see how Indian women from
				Hueyapan, a highland village in the
				state of Morelos, have been encouraged
				to maintain their so-called Indian
				culture—in essence their lower socioec¬
				onomic status—by a nation whose
				revolutionary” ideals call for the pres¬
				ervation of Mexico s indigenous herit¬
				age.
				A Mexican Indian Example
				Looking at the traditional culture of
				Hueyapan is like looking into a reser-
				voir of oppression. It is a mixture of
				cultural hand-me-downs from the rul¬
				ing class, combined with a few vestiges
				from pre-Hispanic times that have
				managed to survive over 400 years of
				Spanish/Hispanic occupation. We
				find, for example, under the rubric of
				indigenous culture, sixteenth-century
				Spanish colonial dress, medieval
				miracle plays, and renaissance double¬
				reeded instruments played only to
				celebrate Catholic fiesta days. As for
				those customs which are truly of pre¬
				Hispanic origin, they have been
				transformed almost beyond recognition
				to conform to the dictates of Hispanic
				cultural rules. What is more, these
				modified indigenous forms frequently
				exist only because they have become
				part of the dominant culture as well.
				After the Revolution of 1910-1920,
				the Mexican government began active¬
				ly to preserve and reinforce so-called in¬
				digenous customs. For ideological pur¬
				poses, political leaders wanted to
				glorify the country’s unique heritage,
				partly Spanish, partly Indian. Artists
				painted, choreographed and wrote
				about Indians, while philosophers phil¬
				osophized about them. Archeologists,
				sculptors and architects labored to
				restore and celebrate pre-Hispanic cul¬
				ture. Folk arts began to flourish. So
				successful was this cultural renaissance
				that by the 1950s tourists were flocking
				to Mexico to visit museums and pre¬
				Hispanic ruins, to purchase inexpen¬
				sive traditional art objects and to travel
				into the interior to see how the Indians
				lived in their natural habitats.
				In the eyes of many Hueyapeños,
				this glorification of Mexico’s “roots'
				can do little more than reinforce their
				oppression. Living in a community
				where the socioeconomic realities of
				their traditional culture prohibit them
				from enjoying the conveniences of
				modern Mexico, they claim that the on¬
				y viable future for the villagers lies in
				losing their Indian identity. Many of
				the young people, particularly women,
				are not waiting for changes to take
				place in Hueyapan and have migrated
				instead to Mexico City and Cuerna¬

         <p>
				vaca. As far as they are concerned, it is
				better to work long hours as maids in
				comfortable homes, or live in the urban
				slums, than to remain in Hueyapan and
				continue their tedious—albeit “folklor¬
				ic”—Indian existence.
				That more women than men want to
				leave Hueyapan is directly related to
				the distribution of so-called traditional
				culture in the village. In a society where
				to be traditional or indigenous still
				brings both low social status and hard
				work, the world of Hueyapan women is
				decidedly more Indian than that of its
				men. What is true here simply supports
				what anthropologists writing about
				modernization have found elsewhere:
				almost always men assimilate more
				quickly in Third World countries, for
				capitalist and socialist systems in¬
				tegrate them more rapidly into urban
				and rural work forces. Women who do
				not become maids in the cities are often
				isolated at home where they provide
				unpaid labor by taking care of their
				husbands and reproducing new work¬
				ers, remaining, as a result, more “con¬
				servative” culturally. Even in places
				where men no longer practice tra¬
				ditional customs, women often con¬
				tinue to do so, speaking the local
				language among themselves, dressing
				in the old way and continuing to work
				with little help from labor-saving tech¬
				nology.? As any Hueyapan woman will
				explain, women who stay in the village
				are the last to change.
				The Mexican government has fur¬
				ther contributed to the division between
				the modernizing man and the tradi¬
				tional woman by its interest in pro¬
				moting indigenous culture. On the one
				hand, it has provided more training
				and technology to change the nature of
				men’s work than women s. On the
				other hand, it has encouraged women
				more than men to develop their tradi¬
				tional skills. In Hueyapan, for instance,
				where weaving still exists, government
				programs have tried to interest local
				women in making shawls, ponchos and
				scarves for the tourist trade. What is
				more, when government represen¬
				tatives come to the village on official
				visits—an event that happens several
				times a year—they appreciate it if the
				Hueyapeños welcome them with an
				ethnic reception. Thus, in the name of
				paying homage to Mexico’s indigenous
				heritage, young girls are dressed up in
				the so-called Indian costume” native to
				the area and receive the honored guests
				with flowers and little speeches in
				Nahuatl.“ Furthermore, women pre¬
				pare a mole meal, the traditional fiesta
				dish, for these government repre-
				sentatives.
			</p>
         <p>
				To move to a more specific analysis,
				we could look at almost any one of the
				so-called indigenous traditions found in
				Hueyapan today to illustrate in con¬
				crete terms how the villagers’ culture
				reflects their long history of being
				dominated by a non-Indian society. Al¬
				though industrialization has hardly
				brought liberation, it is still a fact that
				the poorest rural communities through¬
				out Mexico are generally the most “In¬
				dian. What is more, as these villages
				begin to change, traditional culture
				holds on the longest among the most
				oppressed inhabitants, particularly the
				women, who for social, economic and
				cultural reasons remain more isolated
				from the influences of modernization.
				Given that Mexico is interested in both
				industrializing the country and preserv¬
				ing its so-called indigenous heritage, we
				could suggest that one resolution of the
				problem has been to “develop” one sex
				and sustain the past with the other.
				Drawing on traditional Hispanic
				definitions of sex roles and status dif¬
				ferentiations between men and women,
				the choice was easily made. For pur¬
				poses of this discussion, then, let us
				turn to traditional cooking to see what
				the preservation of this “folk art” has
				meant in the daily lives of Hueyapan
				women.
				The Art of Cooking
				In a recent article entitled The
				Magic of Mexican Food North of the
				Border,” Craig Claiborne whimsically
				begins:
				For some confounding reason known
				only to a few Aztec gods, the authentic
				flavors of the Mexican kitchen, like cer-
				tain fine wines and some exotic plants,
				do not travel well. They transport poor¬
				ly through some curious dilution of
				tastes, some diminution of savor, some
				evanescence of essences [New York
				Times, September 21, 1977).
				Could Claiborne have written this if
				he had tasted Mexican food prepared in
				an indigenous peasant village? His call¬
				ing forth of mystery, humor and ro¬
				mance inadequately describes what one
				experiences in today’s closest equiva¬
				lent to an Aztec kitchen. There, it is
				true, the ingredients are very fresh and
				the food has that special aroma of the
				open hearth, but it also has been
				ground first, for tedious hours, on
				special volcanic stones (metates) that
				are generations old, and cooked in
				earthenware pots seasoned by years of
				use. There is no secret why Mexican
				food does not travel; it cannot even be
				re-created properly in Mexico City,
				much less New York. What we lack are
				the necessary “rustic” working condi¬
			</p>
         <p>
				tions and equipment.
				While members of the privileged
				classes, particularly from abroad, have
				come to appreciate Mexican cooking a
				one of the world’s great cuisines, for
				Hueyapeños it remains one of the end
				less chores that women must attend to
				in the course of a day’s work. As far as
				many villagers are concerned, the food
				they eat and the process involved in it
				preparation are merely additional indi¬
				cations of their inferior status. If they
				had the means, therefore, they would
				stop eating like Indians and would eat
				as they think the rich do, buying food
				in tin cans and cellophane packages
				which they—or preferably a maid
				—would heat quickly over a gas stove.
				Although most Hueyapeños recognize
				that certain foods, tortillas for example,
				taste better when prepared at home, the
				labor entailed is enormous, encourag¬
				ing the women, more than the men, to
				seek ways of simplifying the work.
				In almost every home in Hueyapan,
				the basic daily diet consists of tortillas
				and boiled beans served with chile pep¬
				pers, sometimes in a sauce, sometimes
				just off the vine.? At every meal, even
				among the poorest, one is sure to have
				these staple foods and then, depending
				on the family’s income, the productiv¬
				ity of the barnyard, fields and or¬
				chards, other dishes may be added. At
				breakfast and supper—the latter being
				a very light meal with perhaps only one
				tortilla wrapped around a few beans—
				weak and highly sweetened coffee or
				herbal tea is served, substituted on rare
				occasions by hot chocolate. Coffee, like
				chocolate, is expensive and must be
				purchased, while most of the teas are
				grown locally. Sweet rolls (pan dulce)
				baked in the village and bought at near¬
				by stores are also frequently served at
				breakfast or dinner, particularly to
				children.
				If the family can afford it, women
				usually prepare additional dishes for
				the main meal at midday. Lunch spe¬
				cialties may be nothing more elaborate
				than one of several kinds of chile
				sauces, beans prepared with the flavor¬
				ful ayocote flower or fried in a bit of
				lard. But on market day, a piece of beef
				or pork may also be added (one kilo for
				about 14 people), boiled with season¬
				ings and served in its broth. Beef may
				be cooked in a beef mole soup in¬
				stead. When meat is unavailable or too
				expensive, noodle soup, prepared with
				pork fat, or pork rind fried in a soupy,
				green chile sauce provide substitutes.
				Although chickens and turkeys are
				fiesta foods only, eggs fried in pork fat
				and a chile sauce may also appear, per¬
				haps once a week, in the diet of families

				who raise laying hens or have enough
				money to purchase eggs at the store
				(four or five eggs would serve 14 peo¬
				ple). Another popular dish, when they
				are in season, is stewed prickly pear
				cactus shoots (nopalitos). Finally, after
				fiestas, the leftover mole sauce (see
				below) is used to make enchiladas and
				chilaquiles.
				Women prepare the most elaborate
				meals on fiesta days. Traditionally
				Hueyapeños celebrate at least ten
				village-wide Catholic fiestas as well as
				the individual saint days of members of
				the family. Since the Mexican Revolu¬
				tion, about five national holidays have
				been added. All celebrations, be they
				religious or secular, village-wide or
				family, are feted by serving a tradi¬
				tional menu. Although Hueyapeños
				share responsibilities by sponsoring one
				fiesta or another in a given year, at
				which time they have open house, most
				families who can manage to—and most
				sacrifice so that they can—still cele¬
				brate at home as well, at least for the
				most important fiestas. Relatives, com¬
				padres and comadres (individuals with
				whom the family has a formal ritual
				relationship blessed by the Church),
				and political friends, visit one another
				at these times, eating the same tradi¬
				tional dishes at each home.
				For birthdays and other family¬
				based holidays, there is a special break¬
				fast of atole and meat tamales as well as
				the elaborate midday meal. Meat tam¬
				ales take hours to prepare and must be
				made the night before by a team of
				women—usually the mother-in-law,
				the wife, perhaps a teenage daughter
				still living at home and a comadre or
				two (in particular widows with no fam-
				ily left in the village who have time to
				help on such occasions). Since the work
				goes on late into the night, only to begin
				again before dawn the next day, the in¬
				vited assistants do not bother to go
				home, but wrap themselves up in
				blankets they bring along with them
				and curl up on straw mats placed on the
				dirt floor in the kitchen. Thus, by the
				time the male family members and a
				few guests—mostly men as well—are
				enjoying a tamale-atole breakfast, the
				women have long been at work, some
				looking after the hot atole corn meal
				drink and others attending to the main
				meal of the day, butchering turkeys or
				chickens, cooking the soup, the rice,
				the mole colorado,e the bean and plain
				tamales, the boiled beans and the
				countless tortillas.
				Fiestas, it is true, give women the
				chance to cook, eat and drink together,
				certainly providing some relief from
				their normal routines. Still, the work is
			</p>
         <p>
				exhausting and may go on for several
				days, rarely letting up enough for
				women to have a chance to leave the
				kitchen and enjoy the dancing or other
				party activities. What is more, once the
				holiday is over, women, particularly
				mothers with young children, are faced
				once again with their strenuous daily
				schedules.
				Mexican cooking is difficult and
				time-consuming under traditional
				conditions mainly because almost every
				ingredient must be ground finely by
				hand—from the corn used in tortillas
				tamales and atole, to every spice and
				vegetable added to a mole or chile
				sauce. The work is back-breaking, even
				for women used to it, and must be per¬
				formed kneeling before the large grind-
				ing stone (metate), a kitchen utensil
				known pre-Hispanically throughout

				Since the 1950s Hueyapan has act¬
				ually had a number of corn mills, elim¬
				nating the need to grind corn by hand.
				According to the women, however,
				many men initially objected to the
				mills. Not only did they complain
				about the cost (two cents a bucket), but
				hey did not like the texture of mill¬
				ground tortillas. Corn ground on the
				metates simply tasted better. Another
				innovation which met with a mixed re¬
				action was the tortilla press, used to
				shape tortillas that traditionally are
				fashioned between a woman s'hands in¬
				to paper-thin disks.
				Despite the new improvements, the
				work of “throwing” tortillas remains
				endless, for a family of 14 eats well over
				50 at one meal and expects them fresh
				and hot off the griddle at least twice a
				day. What women really need to
				simplify their work is a tortilla factory,
				where hot tortillas can be purchased
				before each meal. While many non¬
				Indian communities surrounding the
				village have such tortillerías, there is no
				talk as yet of introducing one into
				Hueyapan.
				Given the argument developed so far
				we can now conclude with a few re-
				cipes, letting the descriptions of the
				preparations and the ingredients speak
				for themselves. No attempt will be
				made here to help the reader reproduce
				these dishes in a modern kitchen, nor
				will proportions be systematically pro¬
				vided. Traditional Mexican cooking, at
				least in Hueyapan, has been a matter of
				availability of resources: what has been
				harvested, what the family can afford
				to buy, how many people must be fed
				with a small fixed budget. One chicken,
				for example, can easily serve 20 people.
				When the soup gets low, one just adds
				more water and another leaf of pepper¬

         <p>
				mint. There are no exact amounts of
				this’s and that’s and it would therefore
				be an arbitrary exercise to suggest that
				there were.
				What can be discussed is the labor
				involved in preparing a particular dish
				and whether the ingredients are grown
				locally or must be purchased. Further-
				more we can note the origins of the in¬
				gredients at the time of conquest to aid
				us in identifying the influences Hispan¬
				ic tastes have had on so-called indigen¬
				ous food.
				It will become immediately evident
				that fiesta food, more than the basic
				staples, shows considerable Iberian/
				Old World influence. This is hardly
				surprising when we remember that all
				aspects of the Indians’ ritual life be¬
				came the solemn responsibility of the
				Catholic missionaries who settled in in¬
				digenous towns during the early colon¬
				ial period, converting the people and
				transforming their culture. Hueyapan
				was conquered in 1524, only three years
				after the Aztec Empire fell. By the
				1530s Augustinian missionaries had
				come to the area and by 1561 the Do¬
				minicans had already built a church,
				monastery and several chapels in the
				pueblo (Martinez-Marin, 1968, p. 64ff).
