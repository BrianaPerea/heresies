				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_9_1l7' n='N007'/>from Mexico, however, we should pro¬

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_9_1l9' n='N009'/>cross-cultural analysis by reviewing

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_9_1l11' n='N011'/>United States.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_9_1l12' n='N012'/>Our society has a hierarchical view of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_9_1l13' n='N013'/>art, making rigorous distinctions be¬

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l1' n='N001'/>tween the so-called fine arts and the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l2' n='N002'/>traditional or folk. The nature of fine
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>arts is individualistic, that of the folk,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>collective. The fine arts represent the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>work of specialists, recognized person¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l6' n='N006'/>alities who dedicate themselves almost
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l7' n='N007'/>exclusively to their art. Even when they
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>supplement their incomes with addi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>tional jobs, the culture sees them as art¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>ists first. The folk arts, on the contrary,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>are the work of nonspecialists,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>unknown people who are, perhaps,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>farmers, fishermen, miners, individuals
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>who make modest livings in “old-fash-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>ioned” ways and happen to produce
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>folk art on the side. What is more, ac¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>cording to cultural definitions, folk art¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>ists do not create so much as carry on
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>timeless traditions. They are living
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>vestiges of the past and the more ob¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>scure they are, the more authentic they
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>appear.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>In a culture where progress, special¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>ization and rugged individualism are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>valued, why have we created and main-

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>ditional arts? We could argue that the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>anonymity and timelessness imposed
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>on folk art permit those who practice
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>the fine arts to borrow freely from tra¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>ditional motifs. Who would accuse a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>Bartók of plagiarism just because he
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>used Hungarian peasant melodies?
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>Less cynically, but troubling all the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>same, we might suggest that the alien¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>ation of our lives in modern America
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>has awakened in many a yearning for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>simpler times and forms. Yet in order
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>to have the “folk, a group of people
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>must preserve for us the ways of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>past—in the hills of Appalachia, in the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>African bush or in mud huts in Mexico.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>Feminists today are well acquainted
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>with the cultural strategy that keeps
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l45' n='N045'/>folk artists in the obscurity of their
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l46' n='N046'/>grass-roots authenticity, for women
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l47' n='N047'/>have been erased in similar ways. Like
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l48' n='N048'/>the folk artist, woman is by definition a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l49' n='N049'/>nonspecialist and a carrier of tradi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l50' n='N050'/>tions. She is first and foremost a wife¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l51' n='N051'/>mother whose social and economic
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l52' n='N052'/>duties prevent her from having the time
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l53' n='N053'/>to specialize. Then, even if class
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l54' n='N054'/>privilege gives her the option to refuse
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l55' n='N055'/>her sex’s destiny, she still has to fight
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l56' n='N056'/>the culture’s traditional view that her
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l57' n='N057'/>creative powers are limited by her
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l58' n='N058'/>biology.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l59' n='N059'/>Our culture has so successfully con¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l60' n='N060'/>fined the arts to the male sphere that it
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l61' n='N061'/>has developed sex-specific vocabularies
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l62' n='N062'/>to distinguish work done by men (spe¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l63' n='N063'/>cialized) from that done by women
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l64' n='N064'/>generalized). Thus, although tasks tra-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l65' n='N065'/>ditionally assigned to women usually
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l66' n='N066'/>fall outside the arts entirely, a number
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l67' n='N067'/>of skills become lesser arts when per¬

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>formed by male specialists. Women, for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>example, do sewing and cooking. Men
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>are couturiérs or chefs. Careful to mark
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>the status relationships, we borrow
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>terms from the lofty French to describe
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>the specialized work of a man, leaving
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>the lower-class Anglo-Saxon to identify
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>the chores that fragment a woman’s
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>day. Of course there are female coutur¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>ieres and chefs, and the numbers are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>undoubtedly growing as women today
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>succeed in becoming professionals in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>these and other fields. Yet recent
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>changes do not negate the long cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>history of the sexes in American society
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>in which men (at least of certain
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>classes) have been encouraged to spe¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>cialize, while women (despite their
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>class) have almost always been less rig¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>orously trained, at best educated to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>dabble in a few areas, but by and large
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>inadequately prepared for anything
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>other than, perhaps, wifing and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>mothering.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>While feminist artists continue their
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>struggle to change cultural definitions
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>and thereby gain entry into the male¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>dominated world of the fine arts, some
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>are also trying to open the Academy to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>work usually associated with the “in¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>of women s work. In the process, they
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>have been collecting the nearly forgot-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>ten traditions of women in rural Amer¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>ica and abroad, creating a specifically
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>female folk culture by bringing to light
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>previously unrecognized skills of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>unknown women who never had the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>chance to specialize. Given feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>consciousness, we can hope that those
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>who produce the recently recognized
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>art will emerge from obscurity as indi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>viduals, instead of being reduced to the

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>ally the fate of traditional artists. Still,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l46' n='N046'/>lingering questions must be raised, for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l47' n='N047'/>it is not entirely clear that we see what
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l48' n='N048'/>our interest in folk art may mean for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l49' n='N049'/>those women who happen to be carry-

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l56' n='N056'/>the Mexican and Irish revolutions,

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l58' n='N058'/>Power movements—and it might be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l59' n='N059'/>useful to analyze their histories careful¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l60' n='N060'/>ly. As a start, let us look at postrevo-

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l64' n='N064'/>has been a mixed blessing, particularly
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l65' n='N065'/>for those who have been living the im¬

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>shall see how Indian women from
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>Hueyapan, a highland village in the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>state of Morelos, have been encouraged
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>to maintain their so-called Indian
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>culture—in essence their lower socioec¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l12' n='N011'/>Looking at the traditional culture of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l13' n='N012'/>Hueyapan is like looking into a reser-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l14' n='N013'/>voir of oppression. It is a mixture of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l15' n='N014'/>cultural hand-me-downs from the rul¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l16' n='N015'/>ing class, combined with a few vestiges
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l17' n='N016'/>from pre-Hispanic times that have
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l18' n='N017'/>managed to survive over 400 years of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l19' n='N018'/>Spanish/Hispanic occupation. We
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l20' n='N019'/>find, for example, under the rubric of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l21' n='N020'/>indigenous culture, sixteenth-century
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l22' n='N021'/>Spanish colonial dress, medieval

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l25' n='N024'/>celebrate Catholic fiesta days. As for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l26' n='N025'/>those customs which are truly of pre¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l27' n='N026'/>Hispanic origin, they have been
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l28' n='N027'/>transformed almost beyond recognition
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l29' n='N028'/>to conform to the dictates of Hispanic
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l30' n='N029'/>cultural rules. What is more, these
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l31' n='N030'/>modified indigenous forms frequently
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l32' n='N031'/>exist only because they have become
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l33' n='N032'/>part of the dominant culture as well.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l34' n='N033'/>After the Revolution of 1910-1920,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l35' n='N034'/>the Mexican government began active¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l39' n='N038'/>glorify the country’s unique heritage,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l40' n='N039'/>partly Spanish, partly Indian. Artists
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l41' n='N040'/>painted, choreographed and wrote
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l42' n='N041'/>about Indians, while philosophers phil¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l43' n='N042'/>osophized about them. Archeologists,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l44' n='N043'/>sculptors and architects labored to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l45' n='N044'/>restore and celebrate pre-Hispanic cul¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l46' n='N045'/>ture. Folk arts began to flourish. So
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l47' n='N046'/>successful was this cultural renaissance
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l48' n='N047'/>that by the 1950s tourists were flocking
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l49' n='N048'/>to Mexico to visit museums and pre¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l50' n='N049'/>Hispanic ruins, to purchase inexpen¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l7' n='N007'/>That more women than men want to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>leave Hueyapan is directly related to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>the distribution of so-called traditional
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>culture in the village. In a society where
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>to be traditional or indigenous still
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>brings both low social status and hard
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>work, the world of Hueyapan women is
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>decidedly more Indian than that of its
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>men. What is true here simply supports
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>what anthropologists writing about
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>modernization have found elsewhere:
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>almost always men assimilate more
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>quickly in Third World countries, for

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>tegrate them more rapidly into urban
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>and rural work forces. Women who do
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>not become maids in the cities are often
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>isolated at home where they provide
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>unpaid labor by taking care of their
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>husbands and reproducing new work¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>ers, remaining, as a result, more “con¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>servative” culturally. Even in places
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>where men no longer practice tra¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>ditional customs, women often con¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>tinue to do so, speaking the local
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>language among themselves, dressing
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>in the old way and continuing to work
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>with little help from labor-saving tech¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>nology.? As any Hueyapan woman will
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>explain, women who stay in the village
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>are the last to change.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>The Mexican government has fur¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>ther contributed to the division between
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>the modernizing man and the tradi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>tional woman by its interest in pro¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>moting indigenous culture. On the one
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>hand, it has provided more training
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>and technology to change the nature of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l45' n='N045'/>men’s work than women s. On the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l46' n='N046'/>other hand, it has encouraged women
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l47' n='N047'/>more than men to develop their tradi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l48' n='N048'/>tional skills. In Hueyapan, for instance,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l49' n='N049'/>where weaving still exists, government
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l50' n='N050'/>programs have tried to interest local
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l51' n='N051'/>women in making shawls, ponchos and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l52' n='N052'/>scarves for the tourist trade. What is
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l53' n='N053'/>more, when government represen¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l55' n='N055'/>visits—an event that happens several
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l56' n='N056'/>times a year—they appreciate it if the

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l58' n='N058'/>ethnic reception. Thus, in the name of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l59' n='N059'/>paying homage to Mexico’s indigenous
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l60' n='N060'/>heritage, young girls are dressed up in

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l64' n='N064'/>Nahuatl.“ Furthermore, women pre¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>To move to a more specific analysis,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>we could look at almost any one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>so-called indigenous traditions found in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>Hueyapan today to illustrate in con¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>reflects their long history of being
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>dominated by a non-Indian society. Al¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>though industrialization has hardly
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>brought liberation, it is still a fact that
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>the poorest rural communities through¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>out Mexico are generally the most “In¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>begin to change, traditional culture
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>holds on the longest among the most
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>oppressed inhabitants, particularly the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>women, who for social, economic and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>cultural reasons remain more isolated
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>from the influences of modernization.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>Given that Mexico is interested in both

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>could suggest that one resolution of the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>problem has been to “develop” one sex
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>and sustain the past with the other.

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>the choice was easily made. For pur¬

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>been added. All celebrations, be they

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>tional menu. Although Hueyapeños
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>share responsibilities by sponsoring one
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>fiesta or another in a given year, at

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>and political friends, visit one another
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>at these times, eating the same tradi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>tional dishes at each home.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>For birthdays and other family¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>based holidays, there is a special break¬

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>the elaborate midday meal. Meat tam¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>ales take hours to prepare and must be
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>made the night before by a team of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>women—usually the mother-in-law,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>the wife, perhaps a teenage daughter
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>still living at home and a comadre or
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>two (in particular widows with no fam-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>ily left in the village who have time to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l45' n='N045'/>help on such occasions). Since the work
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l46' n='N046'/>goes on late into the night, only to begin
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l47' n='N047'/>again before dawn the next day, the in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l48' n='N048'/>vited assistants do not bother to go
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l49' n='N049'/>home, but wrap themselves up in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l50' n='N050'/>blankets they bring along with them
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l51' n='N051'/>and curl up on straw mats placed on the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l52' n='N052'/>dirt floor in the kitchen. Thus, by the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l53' n='N053'/>time the male family members and a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l54' n='N054'/>few guests—mostly men as well—are
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l55' n='N055'/>enjoying a tamale-atole breakfast, the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l56' n='N056'/>women have long been at work, some
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l57' n='N057'/>looking after the hot atole corn meal
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l58' n='N058'/>drink and others attending to the main
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l59' n='N059'/>meal of the day, butchering turkeys or
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l60' n='N060'/>chickens, cooking the soup, the rice,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l61' n='N061'/>the mole colorado,e the bean and plain
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l62' n='N062'/>tamales, the boiled beans and the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l63' n='N063'/>countless tortillas.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l64' n='N064'/>Fiestas, it is true, give women the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l65' n='N065'/>chance to cook, eat and drink together,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l66' n='N066'/>certainly providing some relief from
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l67' n='N067'/>their normal routines. Still, the work is
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>exhausting and may go on for several
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>days, rarely letting up enough for
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>women to have a chance to leave the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>kitchen and enjoy the dancing or other
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>party activities. What is more, once the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>holiday is over, women, particularly
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>mothers with young children, are faced
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>once again with their strenuous daily
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>schedules.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>Mexican cooking is difficult and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>time-consuming under traditional
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>conditions mainly because almost every
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>ingredient must be ground finely by
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>hand—from the corn used in tortillas
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>tamales and atole, to every spice and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>vegetable added to a mole or chile
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>sauce. The work is back-breaking, even
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>for women used to it, and must be per¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>formed kneeling before the large grind-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>ing stone (metate), a kitchen utensil
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>known pre-Hispanically throughout
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>America.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>Since the 1950s Hueyapan has act¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>ually had a number of corn mills, elim¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>nating the need to grind corn by hand.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>According to the women, however,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>many men initially objected to the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>mills. Not only did they complain
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>about the cost (two cents a bucket), but
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>hey did not like the texture of mill¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>ground tortillas. Corn ground on the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>metates simply tasted better. Another
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>innovation which met with a mixed re¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>action was the tortilla press, used to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>shape tortillas that traditionally are
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>fashioned between a woman s&apos;hands in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>to paper-thin disks.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>Despite the new improvements, the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>work of “throwing” tortillas remains
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>endless, for a family of 14 eats well over
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>50 at one meal and expects them fresh
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>and hot off the griddle at least twice a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>day. What women really need to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>simplify their work is a tortilla factory,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>where hot tortillas can be purchased
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l46' n='N046'/>before each meal. While many non¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l47' n='N047'/>Indian communities surrounding the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l48' n='N048'/>village have such tortillerías, there is no
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l49' n='N049'/>talk as yet of introducing one into
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l50' n='N050'/>Hueyapan.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l51' n='N051'/>Given the argument developed so far
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l52' n='N052'/>we can now conclude with a few re-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l53' n='N053'/>cipes, letting the descriptions of the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l54' n='N054'/>preparations and the ingredients speak
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l55' n='N055'/>for themselves. No attempt will be
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l56' n='N056'/>made here to help the reader reproduce
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l57' n='N057'/>these dishes in a modern kitchen, nor
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l58' n='N058'/>will proportions be systematically pro¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l59' n='N059'/>vided. Traditional Mexican cooking, at
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l60' n='N060'/>least in Hueyapan, has been a matter of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l61' n='N061'/>availability of resources: what has been
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l62' n='N062'/>harvested, what the family can afford
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l63' n='N063'/>to buy, how many people must be fed
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l64' n='N064'/>with a small fixed budget. One chicken,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l65' n='N065'/>for example, can easily serve 20 people.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l66' n='N066'/>When the soup gets low, one just adds
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l67' n='N067'/>more water and another leaf of pepper¬
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>mint. There are no exact amounts of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>this’s and that’s and it would therefore
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>be an arbitrary exercise to suggest that
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>there were.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>What can be discussed is the labor
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>involved in preparing a particular dish
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>and whether the ingredients are grown
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>locally or must be purchased. Further-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>more we can note the origins of the in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>gredients at the time of conquest to aid
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>us in identifying the influences Hispan¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>ic tastes have had on so-called indigen¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>ous food.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>It will become immediately evident
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>that fiesta food, more than the basic
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>staples, shows considerable Iberian/
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>Old World influence. This is hardly
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>surprising when we remember that all
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>aspects of the Indians’ ritual life be¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>came the solemn responsibility of the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>Catholic missionaries who settled in in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>digenous towns during the early colon¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>ial period, converting the people and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>transforming their culture. Hueyapan
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>was conquered in 1524, only three years
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>after the Aztec Empire fell. By the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>1530s Augustinian missionaries had
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>come to the area and by 1561 the Do¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>minicans had already built a church,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>monastery and several chapels in the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>pueblo (Martinez-Marin, 1968, p. 64ff).
