				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>The large, white, airy and austere room
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>with its severely elegant chairs and tables
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>and attenuated, weeping ladies transfixed in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>pale olive or light mauve-colored gesso
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>panels around its walls, is now full. Tea
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>cups chink against saucers, silk-clad wrists
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>are held at a delicate angle, feather-plumed
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>hats bob up and down, white lawn and lace¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>covered bosoms heave sighs of contentment,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>cheeks flush, tongues loosen, and the buzz
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>of women’s talk rises a quaver or two above
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>the level thought acceptable if this room, a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>tearoom, had been found in London. But
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>the like of this room, and others designed by
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>Charles Rennie Mackintosh, architect, and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>his wife, Margaret Macdonald, a decorative
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>designer, was not to be found in London nor
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>in any other smart city in turn-of-the¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>century Britain, but in Glasgow, dirty, ro-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>bust, tough and far-from-genteel Glasgow,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>the industrial capital of Scotland.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>In the late 1890s in the heart of this city&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>sober business district a few strikingly dif¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>ferent and simple tearoom facades ap¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>peared. Their exteriors, interiors, furniture
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>and fittings displayed unconventional solu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>tions, ethereal elegance and flights of im¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>aginative thinking not seen before in the arts
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>of this city. Glasgow was in the throes of an
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>artistic renewal.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>Margaret Macdonald (1865-1933), who
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>contributed designs to the tearooms, and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>her sister Frances Macdonald (1874-1921)
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>were two of a number of women artists who,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>for a short while, helped make the arts alive
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>in Glasgow. What follows is a brief account
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>of their lives, set against the background of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>Glasgow, and a discussion of a few of the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>objects the sisters designed and made.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>The liveliness of the arts in this industrial
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>capital (Europe’s sixth largest city) grew in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>part from its sound economic base. In the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>previous half-century the heavy industries of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>the area, mining and shipbuilding for ex¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>ample, enjoyed boom growth.&apos; And some of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>the profits, often via the increased income
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>and leisure time of Glasgow’s upper and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>middle classes, found their way into the sup¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>port and patronage of local arts. How pleas¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>ant to sit in a new tearoom designed by Scot¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>tish artists of national prominence, with
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>works by local and internationally known
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>painters hung about on the walls, to sit there
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>and eat a quick lunch or to linger leisurely
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>over afternoon tea. How very natural to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>stroll from the tearoom, seek out the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>painters or the craftsmen or women in near¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>by studios, chat with them about their work
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>and sometimes, proudly, bear home a paint¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>ing, a watercolor, or even a beaten metal
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l1' n='N001'/>panel by one of the Macdonald sisters.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l2' n='N002'/>In those days it was safe to bet your last
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l3' n='N003'/>brass farthing that any artist whose work
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l4' n='N004'/>turned your head had been a student at the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l5' n='N005'/>Glasgow School of Art. Founded in 1840,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l6' n='N006'/>the school grew out of the firm conviction
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l7' n='N007'/>that well-trained artists and designers could
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l8' n='N008'/>promote both the nation’s esteem and trade.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l9' n='N009'/>Its founders had both insight and acumen.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l10' n='N010'/>Under the bustling leadership of the school&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l11' n='N011'/>young headmaster, Francis Newbery, and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l12' n='N012'/>his wife, Jessie, students in the 1880s and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l13' n='N013'/>1890s received excellent training and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l14' n='N014'/>energetic promotion.? Newbery’s students
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l15' n='N015'/>were also fortunate in that their emerging
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l16' n='N016'/>maturity and talents coincided with their
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l17' n='N017'/>city’s peak industrial, intellectual and ar¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l18' n='N018'/>tistic growth.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l19' n='N019'/>Francis and Jessie Newbery fostered the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l20' n='N020'/>talents of four students in particular: the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l21' n='N021'/>Macdonald sisters and two young men,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l22' n='N022'/>Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Herbert
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l23' n='N023'/>MacNair, interior and furniture designers.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l24' n='N024'/>The sisters were day students and the men
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l25' n='N025'/>were evening students; Newbery, in a cri¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l26' n='N026'/>tique of their works, told the four about the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l27' n='N027'/>similarity of their styles, and suggested they
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l28' n='N028'/>meet.” In about 1895 the sisters and their
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l29' n='N029'/>two friends formed a group, calling them¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l30' n='N030'/>selves simply “The Four.

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>Before they met Charles and Herbert, the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>sisters had already established themselves as
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>designers and craftswomen, showing great
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>versatility in the range of objects they made
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>and the materials with which they worked:
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>embroidered hangings and covers, gesso
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>panels, leaded glass panels, clocks, posters,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>water colors, book illustrations, and their
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>specialty, repoussé metal panels. Margaret
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>and Frances Macdonald worked well as a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>team. Not only did they cooperate on ideas
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>and drawing, but they often bent over the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>same metal panel to work side by side. They
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>enjoyed life. They shared a studio and held
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>salons for all the leading writers and artists
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>of Glasgow. The sisters were more than able
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>to hold their own. During the short years of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>The Four’s” life, from about 1895 to 1899,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>the two women continued to work very
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>closely together. “The Four” exhibited to¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>gether and exchanged ideas and designs.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>The men, for example, designed furniture in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>which the sisters’ decorative gesso panels
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>were inset. The sisters evidently found the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>collective working arrangement to their ad¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>vantage: during these years they produced
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>their most original and vigorous designs.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>In 1899 Frances married MacNair and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>the two moved to Liverpool where he had a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>teaching post. The next year Margaret mar-
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>ried Mackintosh. The MacNairs’ move to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>Liverpool brought the sisters’ working ar¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>rangement and the collaboration of “The
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>Four” to an end. After 1899, the four artists
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>produced independently or collaborated
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>with their marriage partner on design pro¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>jects. Although groups of artists were quite
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>common in those decades (members of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>various small English arts and crafts organ¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>izations around William Morris, Arthur
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>Mackmurdo and Walter Crane worked and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>exhibited together), no two artists during
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>this period seemed to work and live in such
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>close harmony as the two sisters. Their life
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>and work together in the Glasgow studio
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>gave a certain intensity to their work, an in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>tensity which was lost after they separated
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>in 1899.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>The strand of another independent,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>spirited and middle-class woman, Catherine
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>Cranston, is yet to be woven into the story.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>Catherine became a principal patron of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>Charles and Margaret Macdonald.* As the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>creator and owner of the tearooms she com¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>missioned husband and wife to design the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>rooms’ every aspect, from their structure
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>and decoration to designs for posters and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>menu cards. In the tearooms the arts and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>crafts mingled freely and complemented
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l1' n='N001'/>Better yet, Catherine Cranston’s women
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l2' n='N002'/>customers found the environment suppor¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l3' n='N003'/>tive. The tearooms created a social phenom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l4' n='N004'/>enon by becoming “virtually the first places
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l5' n='N005'/>of their kind where even the richest and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l6' n='N006'/>most elegant of Edwardian female society
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l7' n='N007'/>might properly meet without chaperons.”5
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l8' n='N008'/>Unlike the tearoom clientele, Margaret
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l9' n='N009'/>and Frances lived free from the shadows of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l10' n='N010'/>chaperons. By the standards of their day
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l11' n='N011'/>they were liberated. Details of their lives
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l12' n='N012'/>before marriage are poorly documented, so
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l13' n='N013'/>it is difficult to locate the source of their in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l14' n='N014'/>dependence. Since independence and crea¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l15' n='N015'/>tivity are so strongly linked, however, and of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l16' n='N016'/>great interest in the biographies of women
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l17' n='N017'/>artists, I shall undertake a reconstruction of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l18' n='N018'/>their early lives.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l19' n='N019'/>In the late 1880s Margaret and Frances
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l20' n='N020'/>Macdonald returned from England with
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l21' n='N021'/>their father. It is probable that the sisters,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l22' n='N022'/>raised in England, at first felt foreign in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l23' n='N023'/>Glasgow. Events that uproot or bring great
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l24' n='N024'/>changes to lives are often those encouraging
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l25' n='N025'/>a sense of self and a desire to do something
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l26' n='N026'/>with one’s life. Possibly the move to Glas-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l27' n='N027'/>gow acted as a stimulus to the sisters. At any
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l28' n='N028'/>rate, Margaret and Frances knew who they
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l29' n='N029'/>were, knew what they wanted to do and,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l30' n='N030'/>soon after their arrival in Glasgow, first
			</p>
			<pb n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>Margaret, then Frances entered the School
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>of Art.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>Once in the school, the sisters found sup¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>port for their ideas in the presence of other
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>like-minded women, such as Jessie Newbery
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>and their contemporaries, Jessie King,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>craftswoman and book illustrator, and Jane
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>Fonie, an interior designer. A tradition of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>active women had been established at the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>school in 1882 when a group of former
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>students founded the Glasgow Society of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>Lady Artists Club, the oldest women’s club
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>in Britain.“
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>The sisters acquired backbone at the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>school. They were trained in drawing from
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>the model, drawing freehand, anatomical
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>and botanical drawing, as well as ornamen¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>tal design. The school encouraged them to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>develop their own distinctive styles at an
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>early stage. Soon their unrefined and un¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>tamed energies led to bizarre shapes, to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>angular and cutting edges to their female
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>forms.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>Shortly after leaving the school the sisters
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>reputations traveled as far as London. In
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>1896, the London Arts and Crafts Exhibi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>tion Society invited “The Four” to send fur¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>niture, craftwork and posters in the “mod¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>ern style” to that year’s exhibition. The sis¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>ters sent four pieces, two of which they had
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>worked on together: a clock of beaten silver
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l32' n='N032'/>with beaten brass weights and an aluminum
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l33' n='N033'/>pendulum, a muffin stand, a beaten alumi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l34' n='N034'/>num panel, The Star of Bethlehem, by
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l35' n='N035'/>Francis and The Annunciation by
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l36' n='N036'/>Margaret.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l37' n='N037'/>The themes of these early figurative piec¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l38' n='N038'/>es express the sisters two constant icon¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l39' n='N039'/>ographic interests, women and babies. Fre¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l40' n='N040'/>quently the woman/ Virgin appears trapped
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l41' n='N041'/>and isolated within their work. And, though
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l42' n='N042'/>Christian subject matter did not recur as
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l43' n='N043'/>often in the later pieces, apparently the in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l44' n='N044'/>tensity of their religious convictions never
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l45' n='N045'/>dimmed. What a pagan and savage inter¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l46' n='N046'/>pretation they gave to their Virgin and Child
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l47' n='N047'/>images. London eyes boggled.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l48' n='N048'/>In the mid-1890s the English arts and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l49' n='N049'/>crafts movement was dominated by William
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l50' n='N050'/>Morris’s most faithful disciple, Walter
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l1' n='N001'/>Crane. His designs pleased everyone, but
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l2' n='N002'/>then they were too innocuous to do other-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l3' n='N003'/>wise. The polite London art crowd moving
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l4' n='N004'/>from a Crane to a Macdonald cried out,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l5' n='N005'/>The Spook School!”
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l6' n='N006'/>We can see why. Look at a mirror frame
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l7' n='N007'/>(Figure 5) made by Frances in 1896-1897.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l8' n='N008'/>Two excruciatingly thin female figures with
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l9' n='N009'/>ghoulish eyes point accusingly at each other
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l10' n='N010'/>over the seed cases of the Honesty plant.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l11' n='N011'/>The seed pods look like death’s heads. And
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l12' n='N012'/>how spooky is the round copper sconce
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l13' n='N013'/>made by both sisters in 1896-1897 (Figure
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l14' n='N014'/>1). Imagine it nailed to the wall of a dark¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l15' n='N015'/>ened room and lit by the fluttering light of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l16' n='N016'/>candles in its holders. Visualize how the eyes
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l17' n='N017'/>in the round copper plate, and in its sup¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l18' n='N018'/>ports, might enlarge and shrink in the jump¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l19' n='N019'/>ing shadows of candlelight. Now look at the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l20' n='N020'/>two female figures, with scraggy, flattened
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l21' n='N021'/>torms and hanging breasts imprisoned with¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l22' n='N022'/>in the rectangular panels of a pair of beaten
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l23' n='N023'/>brass candle sconces (Figures 2 and 3),
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l24' n='N024'/>designed by the two sisters in the same
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l25' n='N025'/>years. Strange details give the figures in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l26' n='N026'/>these sconces an apocryphal air: attached to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l27' n='N027'/>one figure is an orb, supporting a baby
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l28' n='N028'/>suckling at the breast; on the other a cres¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l29' n='N029'/>cent moon superimposes its cruel edges and,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l30' n='N030'/>in the outspread hands of the same figure,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l31' n='N031'/>vivid marks, more like stigmata than wrin¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l32' n='N032'/>kles, are slashed in the open palms. The air
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l33' n='N033'/>of suffering and martyrdom in these figures
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l34' n='N034'/>is so marked that I find myself speculating
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l35' n='N035'/>whether the sisters, consciously or uncon¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l36' n='N036'/>ściously, made associations between these
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l37' n='N037'/>two female figures and the sacrificial roles
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l38' n='N038'/>lived out by the majority of women they
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l39' n='N039'/>knew. But not themselves; at this point they
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l40' n='N040'/>were still free.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l41' n='N041'/>The sisters might have felt dashed by the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l42' n='N042'/>epithet “The Spook School” since the Arts
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l43' n='N043'/>and Crafts Exhibition Society never asked
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l44' n='N044'/>them or “The Four to exhibit again. How¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l45' n='N045'/>ever, Gleeson White, editor of the influen¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l46' n='N046'/>tial arts magazine The Studio, responded
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l47' n='N047'/>enthusiastically to the originality of their
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l48' n='N048'/>designs and visited Glasgow to find out
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l49' n='N049'/>more about the arts and crafts movement
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l50' n='N050'/>there. After his visit, The Studio published
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l1' n='N001'/>a two-part article on the Glasgow artists
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l2' n='N002'/>with part one almost entirely devoted to the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l3' n='N003'/>Macdonald sisters’ works.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l4' n='N004'/>Gleeson White was impressed that the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l5' n='N005'/>sisters not only designed all the pieces he
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l6' n='N006'/>saw but, apart from some joinery work, they
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l7' n='N007'/>handled, beat and wrought even the large
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l8' n='N008'/>and heavy pieces themselves, including two
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l9' n='N009'/>floor-standing clocks. Neither sister was
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l10' n='N010'/>covetous of her individual contribution to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l11' n='N011'/>the pieces they jointly designed and execut-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l12' n='N012'/>ed. They refused to be drawn into games of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l13' n='N013'/>identification.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l14' n='N014'/>After looking at their early emaciated
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l15' n='N015'/>figures, the inflated look the sisters’ works
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l16' n='N016'/>acquire in the early 1900s comes as a sur¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l17' n='N017'/>prise. Reproduced here is a panel Margaret
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l18' n='N018'/>designed in colored plaster for the Rose
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l19' n='N019'/>Boudoir (Figure 6), shown at the Interna¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l20' n='N020'/>tional Exhibition, Turin, 1902. Some of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l21' n='N021'/>Frances’s figures acquire a similar full¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l22' n='N022'/>blown look in these years. In the early 1900s
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l23' n='N023'/>the sisters changed their models; the in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l24' n='N024'/>fluence of Japanese prints and works by the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l25' n='N025'/>pre-Raphaelites superseded the earlier
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l26' n='N026'/>sources of Celtic art, Aubrey Beardsley and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l27' n='N027'/>Jan Toorop.1° In the 1900s an inventive note
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l28' n='N028'/>appeared in Margaret’s use of junk mater
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l29' n='N029'/>ials: colored glass, rope and plaster. The
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l30' n='N030'/>materials cost little and gave a rich, jeweled
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l31' n='N031'/>effect. But the rawness, the evil, the spirits
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l32' n='N032'/>that had made their early metal pieces fairly
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l33' n='N033'/>rattle, had gone. No amount of fancy cur¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l34' n='N034'/>vilinear lines or innovative mixing of media
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l35' n='N035'/>could atone for this. Do success and mar¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l36' n='N036'/>riage account for this transformation of the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l37' n='N037'/>sisters works?
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l38' n='N038'/>No matter the causes, each new develop-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l39' n='N039'/>ment the sisters and their husbands brought
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l40' n='N040'/>forth was eagerly seized upon by their au¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l41' n='N041'/>dience on the Continent. In 1900 they were
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l42' n='N042'/>invited to furnish and decorate an entire
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l43' n='N043'/>room at the eighth Secessionist Exhibition in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l44' n='N044'/>Vienna. In 1902, along with other Glasgow
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l45' n='N045'/>artists, they exhibited works in the Scottish
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l46' n='N046'/>section of the International Exhibition of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l47' n='N047'/>Decorative Art in Turin. Everything the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l48' n='N048'/>four artists sent to the two exhibitions sold.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l49' n='N049'/>Between 1899 and 1905, articles, reviews
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l50' n='N050'/>and illustrations of their works appeared

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>frequently in influential journals such as

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>issue to them.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>Suddenly, in 1905, curiosity about the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>four artists declined on the Continent. Even
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>in Scotland the number of commissions
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>began to drop; England never revived the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>brief interest it had displayed in 1896.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>Though Charles and Margaret had a highly
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>successful exhibition in St. Petersburg in

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>and though one other show was planned for
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>Paris in 1914, the successes of their first
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>heady decade were never repeated.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>It becomes impossible to find published
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>reproductions of the sisters&apos; works after
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>1905. One of the last I found is a gesso panel
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>made by Margaret in 1905 (Figure 4). Un¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>deniably, this is the most powerfully model¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>ed piece yet seen, but the subject shows a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>dangerous stagnation. It is no more than a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>summation of themes explored earlier by the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>sisters. For whom were those plaster tears
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>meant to fall? Catherine Cranston’s
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>tearoom clientele? Or Margaret and her
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>sister? Did Margaret begin to feel she was
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>cast in a mold much as her rope and glass
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>ladies? Did she mourn her lost independ¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>ence? Were her spirits and her creativity
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>slipping away? I believe so, and I am sad-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>dened.

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>People, their deeds, as well as those they
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>avoided doing, affect us mightily. The Mac¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>donald sisters capitulated.&quot; They allowed
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>their strident voices of the 1890s to fade into
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>soothing murmurs and echoes of what once
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>they were. How dared they! (They make it
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>harder for us to shape ourselves into the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>creative and independent beings we would
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>like to be. We need all the positive models
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>we can get our hands on, and here are two
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>more negative ones.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>Did this change in their art reflect the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l47' n='N047'/>constraints of their times? Yes. It was dif¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>ficult for women in turn-of-the-century
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l49' n='N049'/>Glasgow to train and practice as architects,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l50' n='N050'/>as the Macdonalds’ husbands did. Both sis¬

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>ters would have benefited from the training

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>crafts, despite the sincere activities of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>William Morris who tried to unite the arts
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>and the crafts (and all the activities and or¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>ganizations that this engendered) remained
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>very much a poor relative of their rich aunt,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>Fine Art. Margaret and Frances worked at
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>their drawing boards and hammered out
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>their metal panels. They probably wondered
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>what the studio people were up to. Fine art-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>ists (among them women) painted decadent
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>images of women—think of Beardsley’s art.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>Could Margaret and Frances humbly work-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>ing in the lower echelons of the crafts not
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>pick up those cues? As craftswomen work-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>ing in a stratified society, it might not have
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>occurred to them to push their early in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>dependent spirits farther than they did.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>The Macdonald sisters’ best years were
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>all too short. Their career spanned the per¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>iod of the realliance between the arts and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>the crafts and its subsequent deterioration.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>Neither Glasgow’s renaissance of the arts
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>nor women’s independence survived two de¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>cades. The cycles of local movements were
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>taken up within the larger motions grinding
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>inside the machinery of Western capitalist
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>society in the years preceding World War I.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>When the confidence, energy and profits of

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l33' n='N033'/>arts. In the depression of the 1930s, one of
