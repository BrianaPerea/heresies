				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>There are a number of traditional ways
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>of explaining violence in human culture.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>The perspective on violence is usually con-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>gruent with a set of beliefs about the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>sources of human motivation and behav-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>ior. The argument has often been
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>drawn along the Nature/Nurture divide,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>with biology and culture placed in oppo-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>sition to each other. We need to question
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>explanations based on erroneous assump-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>tions and explanations which cannot ac-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>count for the male use of violence against
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>women in specific historical periods and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>social contexts. We need to be critical of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>simple answers whether they are presented
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>by male scientists or feminist authors. The
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>stance of a self-reflective movement re-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>quires a careful evaluation of answers that
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>mask ideology or refuse to include
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>counter-examples, including the ways in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>which women participate in violence and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>oppression. Locating the cause of violence
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>within biology, socialization or a violent
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>society posits the cure for that violence
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>within its own terms. Biological explana-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>tions demand biological treatment. Im-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>plicit in all theories of causation are the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>appropriate remedies or &quot;cures.&quot; There
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>are three broad theories about the causes
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>of violences.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>1) Biological Explanations—Socio-biolo-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>gy, a newer version of biological deter-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>minism, seeks to explain human behavior
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>as the result of complex interaction be-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>tween genes, drives and instincts and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>social environment. In this view, based on
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l1' n='N001'/>hormonal differences, male aggression
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l2' n='N002'/>and violence is inevitable and natural:
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l3' n='N003'/>&quot;boys will be boys.&quot; The only appropri-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l4' n='N004'/>ate treatment is short-circuiting these
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l5' n='N005'/>drives by lobotomies, physical or chemical
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l6' n='N006'/>castration or a eugenics program that will
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l7' n='N007'/>breed gentler men. Some women would
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l8' n='N008'/>dispense with men altogether and institute
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l9' n='N009'/>a program of parthenogenisis. Similarly,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l10' n='N010'/>those who attempt to explain women&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l11' n='N011'/>subordination as a result of physiological
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l12' n='N012'/>differences in strength offer a biological
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l13' n='N013'/>determinist argument. This view rein-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l14' n='N014'/>forces the status quo, as violence is seen to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l15' n='N015'/>be inherent in the human race.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l16' n='N016'/>2) Psychological Explanations — Here
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l17' n='N017'/>violence is not seen as a species problem
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l18' n='N018'/>but an individual problem. Usually vio-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l19' n='N019'/>lence against women is termed an illness
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l20' n='N020'/>or pathology, an unfortunate deviation
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l21' n='N021'/>from &quot;normal&quot; male behavior. While
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l22' n='N022'/>some psychologists might believe it is na-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l23' n='N023'/>tural for men to be aggressive and violent,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l24' n='N024'/>some forms of violence are &quot;sick,&quot; like
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l25' n='N025'/>rape and child molestation. The choice of
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l1' n='N001'/>treatment depends upon whether the vio-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l2' n='N002'/>lence is seen to be deeply embedded in the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l3' n='N003'/>unconscious during childhood or the re-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l4' n='N004'/>sult of learning inappropriate behavior.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l5' n='N005'/>If the key to male violence is to be
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l6' n='N006'/>found in the unconscious then only an ex-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l7' n='N007'/>amination of intrapsychic structures can
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l8' n='N008'/>explain its occurence. This model claims
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l9' n='N009'/>that the Unconscious is basically un-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l10' n='N010'/>bounded by history or culture, though
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l11' n='N011'/>influenced by socio-economic factors.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l12' n='N012'/>Unconscious structures are seen to be uni-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l13' n='N013'/>versal and as deeply embedded as
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l14' n='N014'/>language.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l15' n='N015'/>Many psychologists who do therapy
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l16' n='N016'/>with sexual aggressives, a clinical name
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l17' n='N017'/>for rapists and wife abusers, endorse be-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l18' n='N018'/>havior modification therapy. They believe
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l19' n='N019'/>that violence and aggressive sexuality are
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l20' n='N020'/>learned. The goal of treatment involves
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l21' n='N021'/>unlearning and relearning new modes of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l22' n='N022'/>communication. Some programs teach
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l23' n='N023'/>volunteer rapists (those that are not in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_11_1l24' n='N024'/>prison) how to have better heterosocial

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>skills; the contention being that these men
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>are often not assertive with women and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>fear rejection. Family therapists teach
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>husbands new ways of communicating

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>book on the table instead of hitting her,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>and wives are instructed in &quot;negotiating&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>procèdures. In this way their deviant be-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>havior will be brought into line with that
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>of &quot;normal&apos;&apos; men. Questions of power
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>differences between husbands and wives
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>in the family and men and women in soci-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>ety are ignored, as well as traditional sex
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>role definitions.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>3) Sociological Explanations—Here be-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>havior is not simply a result of human
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>nature but is primarily conditioned by the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>environment. Violence is not an irrational
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>phenomenon, nor is it an individual prob-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>lem (though it is experienced individually).
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>Violence has a social function; as a re-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>source to be implemented when other
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>resources are lacking. It is often seen as a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>last resort, to be called into play when
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>power and authority are threatened, as in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>the case of the State quelling revolts or re-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>bellions. Violence can also be used as an
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>interpersonal resource by individuals
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>when others means of exercising control
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>are blocked or lacking. This view inter-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>prets violence against women in the home
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>as a husband&apos;s reaction to his questioned
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>authority in the household. Women are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>often beaten when they are pregnant and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>also during periods of economic insta-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>bility. It is assumed that violence can be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>used to buttress male status in the family
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>and the community. If men rape women,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>if they terrorize us in our homes and har-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>ass us on the street it is because men are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>utilizing a behavior (privilege) that is
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>available to them as men, social beings
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>operating within the rules of a culture. Is
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>violence the backlash of a threatened
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>power-holder?
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l46' n='N046'/>Another social explanation is that vio-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l47' n='N047'/>lence is the symptom of alienation. Men
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l48' n='N048'/>as workers are frustrated because condi-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l49' n='N049'/>tions of labor are exploitative and social
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l50' n='N050'/>relations demeaning. The ultimate cause
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l51' n='N051'/>of violence then is an alienating social life
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l52' n='N052'/>under capitalism. This theory does not ac-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l53' n='N053'/>count for the direction of the violence by
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l54' n='N054'/>class, race and gender, nor does it explain
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l55' n='N055'/>male violence in non-capitalist societies.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l56' n='N056'/>Certainly the social conditions facing

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_10_1l3' n='N003'/>and life chances do not instill in us a sense
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_10_1l4' n='N004'/>of security or safety. We are paid less
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_10_1l5' n='N005'/>wages, have worse working conditions

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_10_1l9' n='N009'/>alienation, neither view relates frustra-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_10_1l10' n='N010'/>tion/aggression theory to an analysis of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_10_1l11' n='N011'/>gender relations. Violence is always re-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_10_1l12' n='N012'/>lated to the structure of power.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_10_1l13' n='N013'/>What most approaches to male violence
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_10_1l14' n='N014'/>share is the belief that sexual coercion and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_10_1l15' n='N015'/>physical violation are somehow non-ra-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_10_1l16' n='N016'/>tional or uncontrollable. Pent-up frustra-
